"
#0002",college_women,I dreamed that I was in the office of the directress or nurses in the nursing school. She is about forty-five years old. She told me the results of an I.Q. test which I had taken in a psychology class. [I really did not take this test.] The I.Q. for this test was 169. She told me that my I.Q. for the test I had taken in the nursing school was only 80. She said that if I had made a higher score in the nursing test I would have received more credit hours for the training that I received from my hospital at home. [I did take a nursing pre-entrance examination. This test determines the number of credit hours that a nurse receives for her student training when she enters the graduate school.]
"
#0007",college_women,I was in charge of a floor in our hospital in M. One of the nurses that was working on the floor was very untidy about the appearance of her hair. I remember that it was my duty to tell her that she must do something to her hair so that it would be tidier and neater. The other nurse is about my age - maybe younger. I told her about her hair and then the dream was gone.
"
#0008",college_women,"I dreamed that I went to take an examination and I was late for the class. There were ten minutes left in the period and the teacher was one that I had for an English course last term. The teacher told me that I should take the examdnation and to write as quickly as possible so that I could get some credit. I took a seat and was unable to find my pen. I looked through my purse frantically and finally found the pen, but it didn't have any ink in it. I got some ink from the desk and then I couldn't find my blue book. I just had a few minutes left when I did find the book so I quickly wrote out the answer to the first question. Then the bell rang. When I handed in my book, I felt that I had failed the examination."
"
#0010",college_women,"I dreamed that I was in one of my classes and we had just received the results of an examination we had taken about a week ago. I looked at my grade and it was marked ""90 - 30, grade 60"". I asked the teacher why I had thirty points taken off of my grade, and she said, ~You used a blue book that had notes in the back of it."" I looked over the book and showed her that the notes were pertaining to another course. She said that she would give me the original grade but I should be careful of this in the future. My teacher was a lady about 40-45 years of age."
"
#0025",college_women,"As I first remember the dream I was upstairs in a room with my sister-in-law, who is a nurse. I was mixing some blue chemicals. We were talking happily, next I was out in another room with my girlfriend from school. A teacher, whom I can't recall, was lining all the girls, (many of whom I recognized and spoke with) in a straight line to have their tonsils out. I stood in the line at first and then, finally remembering that I had had my tonsils out, I left with my girlfriend. We went downstairs and there in a little room off to one side, were a group of fellows singing and laughing. We stopped and talked with a few, and then we left."
"
#0026",college_women,"I was standing in a room, and appeared to be very thin. I then remember trying on coats and remember saying that I would not buy a ""hat."" I seemed angry at someone for even suggesting that I buy a hat, but cannot remember seeing anyone with me in the dream."
"
#0028",college_women,"I was at a factory working. I saw a college girl-friend of mine. I went out to lunch, and while outside, it started to rain very hard. I returned to the factory early from my lunch and asked my girlfriend if she would lend me her head-scarf. She said ""yes"" and, after putting it on, I went outside again."
"
#0049",college_women,"I dreamed I was in N__ Y__ with my family. We were out at a big building which someone said was M-- S-- G--. It was dark green with the sides open and extended for miles. We stood beside it for a while and then got on the subway to go back to the center of town. The subway was run on the same principle as a roller coaster. We went on a level for a while and then zoomed up an incline. Every time we stopped I was tilted to the side. Finally we got off the ""subway"" and stood looking at a large wall map of C-- painted as a mural and put on a cement wall. From there the dream is a blur. I remember my Mother sat in the seat beside me, however, on this ""subway"", and my Father was in front."
"
#0050",college_women,"I was dreaming about taking some sort of trip. I arranged 4 packs of cigarettes, Lucky Strikes, which were partially empty, each to different degrees, to divide my vacation into four parts. I gave them to someone, telling what date each stood for, I remember one that was for July 20, the other dates have faded. One pack was almost empty, having 4 or 5 cigarettes left. Transition here fades and I was then in a store trying to use a pack of tickets for a trip on some lake. The man I was talking to runs the soda fountain at the corner drug store. He told me that I must have 2 tickets next to each other on the ship with the number 34 at the bottom right hand corner of each one. The tickets were arranged with numbers much like on a calendar. I didn't find tickets arranged this way I only found one that had a 34 on the corner. Transition again fades and changes and I was on the edge of the lake. English professors began appearing, mostly ladies. They had dangling earrings, and once again numbers came into my dream. There was English 309 A, English 219, etc. and each one had a professor appearing for it. I was awakened at this point."
"
#0052",college_women,"I dreamed there were hundreds of airplanes flying over our house, which was transferred into a new setting. I stood over a broad field to watch the planes. They were a very peculiar shape which I can't describe but can draw--. I guess I can't even do that but can still see them there in my minds eye. They were yellow and, black and flew en masse in a seemingly unending supply. I remember vaguely that a man jumped out of one of them and parachuted down to earth. I approached him when he landed. He stuck his foot through the silk and tore the chute badly. I think I contemplated that the material would have been nice for a nightgown or slip."
"
#0059",college_women,"After the alarm clock rang, I apparently dozed off to sleep again and I remember hearing my father-in-law and the maid talking outside our door as to whether or not to call us. So, in a loud voice I yelled, ""We're awake"". When I actually did wake up, I asked my husband whether he heard me yell and he said he didn't. Neither were my father-in-law & the maid talking outside our door. It seemed so real, that it was hard to believe that it wasn't."
"
#0062",college_women,"I cannot remember the details of the dream except that my mother had to go to jail for something that I knew she hadn't done. It was about 6 o'clock in the morning and she wanted to drive to jail alone but I insisted that I'd take her. She felt very badly about having to go to jail, and I tried to comfort her. When I went out to get the car, I couldn't back out of the driveway because a black car was parked horizontally across the driveway. I wasn't very worried about my mother having to go to jail because I was positive she was innocent.  Somewhere, a slouchy looking man with a hat on kept beckoning with his finger to me but I only made faces at him to try to scare him away."
"
#0076",college_women,"I was riding the streetcar, either with, or going to meet, my boyfriend, E--. (I can't remember which. It might have been both, at different points in the dream, which was very confused). Somehow, there were several children in the dream, not mine, but someone else's. I cant remember how they fit in."
"
#0081",college_women,"I was riding on a bus with some other girls. I can't remember who any of them were, but I believe they were all from M--. I don't know where we were going or why, but it must have been a fairly long trip for we had to stop off for two meals, lunch and dinner. Each time, after we were in the cafeteria and had our food, I discovered that I had left my money in the bus, and had to borrow it from somebody. I can't recall anything about the bus ride. I just seemed to know we had been riding, without experiencing the ride itself."
"
#0087",college_women,"I was apparently visiting another college. I don't know which one or why. For some reason I was in one of the dormitories, trying to find out what the rules were regarding late nights. Nobody seemed to be around. Finally, I found a girl who was sleeping but who awakened as soon as I came into her room. I apologized for waking her and asked her about the late nights. I don't remember what her answer was, but somehow it came out that this dorm was named M. H., at which I was very pleased, since that is the dorm I live in. As I was leaving her room, I remembered that I had her scissors in my hand (I don't remember why). I took them back, assured her I hadn't meant to steal them, and went out. (I think that this was only a small part of a much longer dream, but I can't remember the rest of it."
"
#0100",college_women,I found myself in a room alone. Water was flowing from walls and I was trying desperately to stop the water with my fingers.  Scene changed and I found myself standing alone holding my pinkie ring broken in two in my palm.  Scene changed again and my mother and I were outside a bar. Two dimly-seen men were fighting and I was doing my best to cross the street and get mother away from harm.
"
#0101",college_women,"I was at a house party. An old boyfriend of mine was there. We were playing games in one room. He was with another crowd in another room. There was a commotion and a man lay dead on the floor. My old boyfriend lay down on a bed in one of the bedrooms and felt miserable. I tried to comfort him. Two boyfriends of his tried to talk him into going to a very good show in town. I talked to him again but it didn't look as if he were paying any attention to us. The two fellows and myself started to the show. As we walked along the street, he caught up to us, handed me a bunch of pansies and said ""Here's a dollars' worth of posies."" He took my arm and we all walked on together."
"
#0103",college_women,There were two girls and myself sitting around a table in H-- Hall. We were watching a fellow and girl come down the steps. Each of us knew the fellow and one by one we told each other of our experiences with him. Each story was similar to the other. There was a fourth vacant chair and we expected the girl he was with to fill it.
"
#0107",college_women,"My shoes needed soles but since I couldn't find a shoemaker, I used money (paper bills) instead. I put on an old, worn-out $5.00 bill on my left shoe but found it was so weak, I was afraid to walk on it."
"
#0108",college_women,A friend of mine (male) came over and came into the bedroom with me where I was sitting on the bed and listening to the radio. The next thing I knew he was stretched out under the covers of the bed fast asleep and I was lying fill length along the bed but above the covers.
"
#0109",college_women,I dreamt I was sitting in my living-room when a married girlfriend of mine came in with a date who was not her husband. She seemed very gay and happy and said she was going to go out with this fellow just as a lark.
"
#0115",college_women,"It was raining in my dream and I was coming out of the hospital going over to another building. I remember that as I was running across I noticed the long line of people standing in line, out in the rain waiting to be seen by the doctor in the out patient Dept. Some were older men and women, and as I entered the hospital I remember feeling upset and despairing about seeing them out in the rain, waiting patiently. I thought that certainly other arrangements could be made for these people."
"
#0116",college_women,"I went to the store to buy a newspaper, which cost three cents. Had a five dollar bill with me, but I needed the change. The person who waited on me apparently couldn't make change for he keep over charging me. I keep insisting that the paper was only three cents, that he wasn't giving my correct change. I was growing impatient as I was suppose to have an appointment at 8 o'clock. I don't remember who the appointment was with however. It was growing very late, and getting dark outside. I remember calling to another person, apparently the owner of the store to come over & show this boy how to count. He told me the reason for the mistake was that you had to pay for the service besides the paper, and so it really wasn't a mistake at all. The last thing I remember is that I left the store without the paper, already late for my appointment and very upset."
"
#0122",college_women,"In this dream I was working on two huge size pieces of paper. They were so large that I couldn't reach across them put I had to walk around them. They were both mapped out in various squares. It seemed as if I was trying to make an assignment of patients and I kept placing numbers in the squares, but then would erase it and place it in another place. Others around seemed to be giving me advise where I should assign various people. I began to get discouraged, I had holes in the paper from erasing so much, and it seemed as if I couldn't make the assignment complete in time it should be."
"
#0139",college_women,As a project in one of my classes I had to make some candy which I put in a tin box and then I wrapped the box in striped wrapping paper... The next moment I was at the flower show and there I saw a display of the candy boxes which my classmates and I had wrapped. My box was all covered up by the others. The others were more beautifully wrapped so I took mine and unwrapped it in preparation to re-wrap it. Then I woke up.
"
#0141",college_women,"I was walking on E--- at W--- Park at night. I had on my bridesmaid dress (which I wore at the wedding of my sister). Suddenly a strange man flashed a light in my face and laughed. Then he started chasing me and I ran into a dingy bar. There were many men at the bar and it was very noisy and smoky. I didn't know what to do.... Then I was in a designers shop. My gown had been ruined in some way and three women were making me a new one just like my old. I kept worrying about the time because it seemed as if I should be at the wedding. No one would let me call my parents and I didn't know where I was....  Then I was with my cousin (female-age 5) in a small room--I don't know where. I left and went outside to a parking lot where I found my parents (both 45 yrs. old). Then my cousin came running out and she was crying very hard because she thought she had gotten separated from me. I felt very bad for having left her....  Then a friend of mine (female-age 20) appeared in my newly made dress. I was disappointed because it was a dull brown whereas the original had been a beautiful orange color. I said ""Do you get to have the dress after the wedding?"" She said ""Yes."""
"
#0143",college_women,"I was in a car with my father and mother (both 45 years old) and one other person (perhaps my sister age 22 but I am not sure). We were passing a golf course. Suddenly my father started driving faster, explaining that he had seen a man just drive (hit) his golf ball and he was afraid it might hit one of the windows in our car. The next thing I knew was that the ball had come through the rear window and it hit me on the collar bone which immediately swelled up. Also much glass lodged in my neck. We started home so that I could be doctored. We had only gone a short distance when the bump on my collar bone disappeared and I seemed perfectly well....  Then I came out of a house (not my own home). My friend's mother (age 50) was waiting for me in a big blue car. The car was filled with many other people... Then I was at a party (I don't know where)."
"
#0146",college_women,"My friend (age 23-male), my mother (age 45), my sister (age 22) and I were in my friend's car on B--- Road in front of the M--- Administration Building. We went around the corner on F--- Drive. I was driving. Then suddenly my mother was driving and I was very angry because I wanted to drive. She drove around the corner of F--- Drive onto E--- Ave. Then, again, I was driving. I drove as far as the Church of the C--- and then I stopped, having remembered that there was something at home which I needed. I wanted to drive my friend's car home by myself (30 miles). Everybody was trying to find a solution and it was all very confusing... The scene changed to a room in a dormitory (I don't know where). There were three girls in the room and my friend and I were standing in the doorway talking to them. The next thing I knew my friend was pulling me along the floor by the leg. I got up, ran outside, got in his car and drove off into the sky (as if I were in a rocket ship). Then I became a bystander in the dream and I saw my friend frantically pleading for me to come back. I seemed as if I were going to some distant place to which he could not get."
"
#0150",college_women,"I was standing with my family (mother & father, ages 45 and sister, age 22) and several other unknown people by the runway of an airfield. We watched a very large airplane take off. The crewmen were sitting on the wings and not until the plane had taken off from the ground did they begin to crawl into the plane in single file. It seemed very dangerous. The plane did many loops and turns in the air and I was afraid it would crash. Then there were many miniatures of this large plane which would dive into the ground and then bounce back up into the air. Next a group of jet planes flew by. One of them crashed by my sister. The plane when it crashed turned into a toy airplane. Nevertheless everybody ran except my sister. The next thing I knew, my sister was blind and I felt that it were my fault. I felt very bad but I do not know why."
"
#0158",college_women,"In this dream I remember hearing the news that my mother had died. I remember feeling very upset, at the news. I don't know who told me the news, but soon after I heard it, the telephone rang and I heard my father's voice. He called to tell me about my mother. When he spoke to me, I felt very sorry for him and suddenly pitied him because he would be alone. When he spoke of my mother, I thought of her and at this point had an intense emotional outburst of tears. Later I remember sensing a fear and dread of going to my mother's funeral. I did not wish to see her dead. I then visualized my mother's face before me with her eyes closed. It was very vivid."
"
#0174",college_women,I was sitting in the bathtub in the dormitory. A girl friend of mine from home came and we were talking. I ask her about another friend from home. The friend told me the other girl was not pinned anymore. I was very surprized. Just then the other girl came in and she had just washed her hair and it was quite wet.
"
#0175",college_women,"I had a date with a boy that I used to date about a year and a half ago. I did not want to be with him because I was afraid the boy I am pinned to would see me. We were driving along the road on the way to a dance. When we finally arrived, a girl whom this boy had been dating recently was standing outside waiting for him. I was very relieved. We did not go into the dance but got back into the car again. The other girl sat in the middle. I was impressed by the wierd atmosphere. It was very windy and misty."
"
#0180",college_women,"I was the only girl in a room full of men, none of whom I knew. They were all trying to draw my attention, but I was afraid of them. There was one colored man in the room, and I felt drawn to him. He seemed to be my only friend, and I left the room with him. I walked by his side feeling very secure."
"
#0182",college_women,"Two girls, one a close friend and the other an acquaintance, and I decided to go to Florida. Both of them are my age. When we arrived, the close friend insisted on going to a very expensive hotel where we paid in advance. Then we discovered we had only $11 left between us. I was furious with the girl for putting us in such a spot."
"
#0203",college_women,"I was living with my family in a neighborhood of large, impressive houses. The neighbors were not very friendly. I was standing on a lawn feeling lonely when my aunt appeared. She is about forty. Suddenly, down the street, rode my grandmother on a bright red motor scooter. She was riding very fast and going around corners all the time. My aunt just smiled indulgently. Then a group of girls came up to me and said they had heard my father was a famous baseball player and they wanted to meet him. I took them to a large building. We went inside and walked through a lot of narrow passages and came to two swinging doors. We opened them and saw a gymnasium and some men playing basket ball."
"
#0205",college_women,"An experiment of atomic energy was being made. My father was conducting the test and I was watching. My aunt was to be a victim, along with a young man. They were sent downstairs into 8 dungeon and sealed in. Upstairs, Father threw some switches and an explosion sounded. They were supposed to receive a shock downstairs. A couple of men went down to see how the experiment came out. They brought the victims upstairs. They were still alive, but my aunt's hair had turned gray and she was haggard looking. I was afraid to look at her."
"
#0217",college_women,"I dreamt that I was riding along in a big car, only it wasn't exactly a car. I was sitting in a big easy chair which had with it a long footrest. In the so called car with me was my aunt who was sitting in a chair similar to mine. Still another person was present. At one moment she resembled a classmate of mine, and yet the next moment she resembled no one T knew. I recall the sensation that we were driving over very flat and uninteresting country and that we all couldn't figure out why we didn't stop occasionally. Finally we stopped in front of a huge building of some kind, probably a gas station a little distorted. Everyone got out of the car but me, yet I recall I was the one who wanted to stop the most. Finally I was in the ladies room, the others having returned to the car. Right in the middle of the room, there was ?. big bed. I remember saying to myself that I mustn't lie down even for a minute because the others would worry. However, the next thing I remember was waking up with that awful feeling that they had gone without me, and that I couldn't comb my hair and that I was a wreck in general. At that moment I woke up."
"
#0231",college_women,"I dreamed that I was riding in an automobile with a friend of mine. We were riding out in the country where my house formerly was. We turned into our driveway and as we approached the house, another car was following us. This car was driven by an old friend of the family and with him was his sister. My Mother, at the time, was sleeping in her bedroom, as it was late at night."
"
#0233",college_women,"I dreamed about my first boyfriend whom I had gone with in high school. The dream is rather vague, but he and I were walking along the street in A We were going to get his car which was parked near his father's gas station. He seemed to be much more attentive to me and very much pleased to have me with him. We met some other people but they are too vague for me to be able to identify them."
"
#0239",college_women,"I dreamed about a young married couple whom I have known for a long time. They came to see us at our home. Although the home was ours, it resembled my Uncle's home in C___ and yet the dream seemed to take place in C ___.. They drove up in a Model A Ford & parked it in the front yard. We were in the living room talking when another Model A Ford drove up & in it were my sister & a friend of mine. I went out in the front yard, got in this couple's car, and started to talk to my sister. D___ my sister, asked me if I wanted to go to a play with J. She said that she and her husband weren't going. I realized that I would have to go with him alone, so I refused. Then they drove away and the wife came out in the yard. She seemed perturbed at my getting into their car, so she got into the car and backed it away. The car then suddenly changed into an old-fashioned bicycle. It was at this time that I felt antagonistic towards this couple."
"
#0240",college_women,"This dream took place in a large room which is unfamiliar to me. In this room was a long table and on it were some presents and some graduation pictures of me. The room was filled with people - neighbors, friends and relatives. Two of my neighbors, who are 8 and 12 years of age, were standing near the table passing out my graduation pictures to anyone who wanted them. I was trying to stop them and at the same time I was wondering how I was going to pay for them. The gifts on the table were for me. I opened them and each gift seemed to be a deck of playing cards except the last one I opened. It was yarn for knitting, knitting needles, and all the necessary implements needed to knit socks. I remember thinking to myself that now I would have to learn to knit."
"
#0245",college_women,"I went to a school because I wanted to be a teacher and I thought I would have to speak to a teacher I had when I was in 3rd grade, to get a position. I found her in a library. It was a very elaborate, comfortable library and the class of little children were climbing all over the furniture. When I came in the children climbed all over me, and the teacher was trying to talk to me but the children kept interrupting."
"
#0246",college_women,"I was taking an examination in writing letters which were to be sent to W----. My grandmother and a friend with whom I am only slightly familiar, female named C----, were in the examination. However, the city and government were so corrupt that the letters didn't get through.

"
#0250",college_women,I was in a large modern hamburger stand. I was waiting for a bus. I saw several buses outside that would pull around a circular plot of grass in front of the store. I stood at a tall window looking out of the window. While waiting I ate potatoe sticks and fritos (both of which I do not care for). My arms were full of books and I found it difficult to eat.
"
#0253",college_women,"I dreamt that I was descending the stairs in an unfamiliar hallway. At the bottom a friend, (male, age 26) was waiting. I had something in my hand which caused me to be very embarrassed. At the foot of the stairs there was a small maple chest of drawers in the top drawer of which I deposited the article that was embarrassing me. (I don't know exactly what it was.) The man turned me around and kissed me. At first I felt rigid and then I felt as if I were melting and floating away on a cloud."

He had many women & their boy children in this low ceilinged structure (the harem) and periodically went on forays for more captives.

"
#0368",college_women,J--- (engaged to M 22) and I were on our way E--- Beach but first we had to meet several women (F 60-70). These older women were sitting on a sofa with their heads cut off. We went up some stairs and got into a roller coaster car. The tracks were covered with small fire crackers which started to go off when we came to the end of the ride. We got back in the car and some-one called to us and asked us to take a boy we had never seen before to the doctor. Several other young people (20-25) got into the car and I woke up.

"
#0372",college_women,I dreamed I was in the room of an old house which over looked a wide river. The river was very high almost to the edge of the wide windows facing the water. I went out of the house and got into a boat and sailed back and forth in front of the wide windows. Suddenly there was thunder and rain. The house melted away. The woman who owned the house--(the mother of one of my friends) drove her car to the river's edge and I got in. There was another clap of thunder and I awoke.
"
#0376",college_women,"This is only a snatch of a dream. I was walking down S--- Avenue at dusk when a colored man jumped out of a doorway and pulled me back into the shadows of a dime store's entrance. He began to molest me while I fought wildly and called to the passers-by for help. The people walking past were people I knew, but I cannot identify them. They looked at me as if nothing was happening, waved and smiled, and walked on."

#0387",college_women,"I dreamed I was upstairs in H--- Hall making a phone call to a girlfriend. (She is 20) At times I seemed to be in a bedroom & at other times the hall was being used as a dining hall. There was a large, long table at which many M--- girls were sitting. I kept talking on the phone & the girls at the table kept calling for me to come eat. Then the scene was again changed to a bedroom & I was still on the phone. All at once some girl came bounding through my room on her hands & feet, like an ape. I thought she was just kidding & then another girl stuck her head in the door & and said ""Did you see her?"" I told her I had & asked if she were just being silly. She said, ""No, she's always like that!"""

#0396",college_women,"I was walking along a path which ran beside a broad, calm river. Then the path turned away fromthe river and ran through a thick forest. The forest began to grow thicker and darker. I was frightened, but something compelled me to walk on. Suddenly, I was out of the woods and standing at the edge of a large open space. In the middle of this clearing I saw a beautiful house. It was a large, white house with blue awnings at the windows, and three white pillars at the front. Hundreds of yellow roses were climbing around the pillars. It was a lovely scene, but it was very frightening. I wanted to go back, but something seemed to draw me toward the house. Then, as I came close to it, the whole house began to tremble and collapse. I turned and began to run toward the forest. Before I reached it, I awoke. Even after I awoke, it took a long time to get rid of the feeling of terror."

#0404",college_women,"We were still fighting the Germans and I was still living in W. It was winter and everything was covered with snow. German planes began to fly over the town and I ran down to the basement to hide. Then I could tell by the sound that the German planes had gone and American planes had taken their place. I ran outdoors just in time to see one of our planes begin to fall. It crashed in our front yard and began to burn. Then I saw that the pilot was one of my friends (M-27). I tried to help him out, but before I could get there the crane disintegrated and I was standing in the snow alone."
"
#0407",college_women,"I dreamed that my home was a huge mansion, composed of five floors. My room was on the third floor, and was very small. I remember seeing that everything in it was pink, and it seemed to be long and very narrow. In the dream I found that my sister had a room on the fourth floor which was very huge and done up completely in green. I walked from room to room on the fourth floor, and found that many of my old friends were living in them. Who these friends were is a bit hazy now, but they were people I knew a long time ago. I was very jealous of my sister's room, and I thought it was horribly unfair of my mother not to let me have the room. I thought she should let us alternate using the room. This much is all I can remember."
"
#0410",college_women,"This dream was a very disconnected one. It began when I was riding in a car with my girlfriend's boyfriend. The two of them had had a fight. It seems that we drove for hours and hours. Later I got out of the car and started walking. A middle aged man picked me up and put my suitcase in the back of the car(!!) He kept giving me sly looks and I realized he was going to kidnap me. Five young men came down the street and walked straight towards me. I said, ""Don't you dare take another step!"" and they stopped. The next thing I knew I was in A------. I was walking with someone who was saying something to the Eskimos. It seemed that he was saying ""oogie woogie"" or some similar phrase such as that! I remember it was very cold and there was a sharp wind. I remember seeing a great deal of snow."
"
#0414",college_women,"In this dream my father was going to take a group of us for an airplane ride, including my sister (23), my mother (52), a girlfriend of my sister's (23), and myself. Much of my dream seemed to be composed of an argument I was having with my mother. She wouldn't allow me to go in the plane, and it seemed to have something to do with the kind of shoes I had on! She told me that if I went I would be killed. I remember feeling that I was being persecuted, and my sister was allowed to go while I wasn't.  Suddenly the scene changed and I was at college at M. University. I was walking on the fourth floor of a dormitory, and the floor was broken up into big pieces which were revolving. Someone came up to me and asked me who turned on the switch to have the floors revolve. This was connected with the airplane ride, as someone said that the reason the floor was revolving was because there was an airplane someplace near by."
"
#0417",college_women,I had a job in some sort of plant (factory) and I worked at a machine which resembled a cream separator used on small farms. I cannot recall the operation of this machine at all. The only incident I recall is that I was angry and in this anger the only way of release that I seemed to have was to squash slices of ripe tomatoes over the parts of the machine which stuck out. This act seemed to be a retalitory act.
"
#0435",college_women,"I dreamt that I was to attend a Spanish class at 7:30 at night. I had to go to my room in the dormitory to get my books. I remember taking an escalator to the 2nd floor and meeting a girl on the escalator. I told her to wait for me. When I got to the 2nd floor, I opened the door to my room and discovered it was a classroom. I was very confused. I tried some of the other doors on the floor, but they were all locked. I decided to take an elevator down to the first floor, but here the dream gets rather confused. I seemed to be swinging through hoops. I remember thinking it was like some ride at E. Beach."
"
#0450",college_women,"I remember walking out of a house and continuing my walk down a main thoroughfare. A man (short, middle-aged, shabby) unfamiliar to me is following me. He has something wrapped in newspaper which he wants to sell me. He says something to me and I remember the word ""cotton."" I tell him ""no"" and cross the street. He follows me. Then somehow he gets ahead of me. I throw a glass at him, but miss. I see a group of people gather around a woman who is stretched on the ground. A young woman is crying: She says her mother's hand has been cut off. I draw close and see a huge scar across the hand of the woman. There is no blood. I keep repeating ""I did it, I did it."" I was awakened abruptly by my father at this part--it was 7:10 in the morning."
"
#0459",college_women,"I was in a brightly lighted room in the dormitory with about 10 other people (2 boys). There was an operating table in the middle of the room. Two men walked in the door wearing white coats like doctors wear and carrying huge bags. They were tree surgeons and they had come to operate on a tree. They said they didn't need to wear gloves or use an anesthetic because the tree wasn't really an alive human being. Then they took out a saw and one of them began to saw off slices of the tree supposedly, but it was a human foot. They sliced off pieces just like meat (only it looked like cork). I said I couldn't stay and watch and I ran from the room. One of the fellas said he was staying because he thought it was interesting."
"
#0461",college_women,"I saw H___ A___ run out of a department store in A___ with his arms loaded down with oranges, pears, apples and grapes. He kept dropping fruit all over and he also dropped a toy truck that had a great number of little white blocks in it. The blocks fell out all over the floor and two clerks one a girl and the other a younger boy stopped to pick them up. The girl just stood and counted them while the boy put them in the truck. Among the blocks was a spool of thread. I was watching the proceedings and I was scared that they were going to discover the spool of thread. For some reason if they saw the thread H__ would be in some kind of danger. But the boy thought the spool was another block and put it in the truck. I was relieved and I walked away."
"
#0488",college_women,"An old friend of mine who is 1 1/2 yrs. younger than I came to my house one day, and I was very surprised to see that she was no longer ""pinned."" She has always been an exceptionally pretty girl and she looked even more beautiful this day. When I asked her if she and her boyfriend had quarreled she smiled wryly and took off her skirt. I looked at her standing in her slip and commented that she had put on weight. She laughed and said that she was going to have a baby; and did I blame her now for breaking up with her boyfriend."
"
#0503",college_women,"I dreamed that I was in a doctor's office supposedly receiving a physical examination. However, the doctor merely proceeded to tell me a series of stories and anecdotes which I didn't pay much attention to since I was paying him to examine me. Then he began questioning me on material he had talked to me about, but since I had been bored and had paid little attention, I couldn't answer any of the questions. Since there were a few other people present, we must have been having the consultation in his outer office."
"
#0505",college_women,"I dreamed that I was very anxious to buy a ticket to a certain theatrical production which was being presented. However, after standing in line for a long while I discovered I had no money with me and I was quite distressed about it. One of my friends refused to lend me the money, but another girl whom I knew who was also in line, offered to get the ticket for me. I remember specifically asking her to get tickets in section 999."
"
#0506",college_women,"I dreamed that the Society for the Blind had given my grandfather, who lives with us, two tickets to the opera M-- B--. They were not good seats for seeing the performance, but they were excellent for a blind person who could only hear the music. I very eagerly offered to take my grandfather, so that I could attend the performance because I was very much interested in music."
"
#0507",college_women,"I dreamed that I was watching some sort of group dancing on a large green lawn. The girls wore old-fashioned, brightly colored costumes and appeared to dance in pin-wheel formation. The day was very warm and sunny, and toward the end the dancers seemed to be slightly fatigued--their formations were not as precise and they became more jolly and boisterous. There seemed to be a large group of spectators in a grandstand watching the performance; I was watching also, but I was along the side somewhere."
"
#0520",college_women,"I dreamed I was walking in the country, over gently rolling grassy plains. I was absorbed in thought and was quite surprised when I realized how dark it had become. I started back. Then I heard my name being called very softly. I tried to run in the direction of the man's voice (I did not recognize the voice.) Just as I seemed to be getting closer to the voice, it stopped and came from another direction. I started to run again; each time I thought I was near the source of the voice, it came from another direction. Then I was running about wildly. My clothes and hair were being blown about by the wind. I was sweating profusely and wiped my face on my forearm as I ran. Soon, I became frightened and exhausted. I sat down on a rock and cried and cried. When I raised my head from my arms, it was black out and I couldn't see anything. The voice stopped while I was crying."
"
#0524",college_women,"My mother and I were walking on E1-- St. between E-- and C--. There were many small shops on the street selling millinery and ladies' clothing. All the stores were closed. (This did not seem unnatural; it must have been Sunday.) As I looked in one store, I saw a woman putting hats into a drawer. As we passed, she looked up and I was surprised to recognize her. (We had lived on the same street for 10 years.) I have not seen her for 2 years. She beckoned to us to stop. Then she opened the door and let us in. We talked and she told me she was selling Bissell carpet sweepers and could get us a good discount. Mother said to me confidentially that maybe she ought to buy a Bissell at a discount instead of the electric sweeper she had been wanting. I remember that all the while we were talking, I kept looking at her and thinking how attractive she had become."
"
#0525",college_women,"I was in a shoe store. There were some empty seats, but I did not sit down. Instead, I walked near the rear of the store and waited for someone, the manager or a salesman to notice me. There were 4 seats, similar to the ones for giving shoe shines--There were 2 facing each way (in other words, they were back to back). There were 2 boys sitting in the 2 raised chairs facing me. I did not know the boy farthest from me. The closer one (approximate age 25), I recognized as a boy with whom I'd double dated several times. Then as I was about to say hello to him he stood up and his face changed. I recognized him as another fellow I know (approximate age 20) who had been badly burned in a fire about 5 weeks ago. I knew his face had been burned. When I remembered this fact, I noticed that his face changed. The hairline changed too and I noticed that near the face, the hair was thin and short. I thought that this was because it probably had been burned away and was just starting to grow back. I called his name and he smiled at me."
"
#0527",college_women,"I dreamed my dear friend R., age 22 (female) died. I was very, very upset and wept copiously. I went to her funeral and practically became hysterical. She knew so little happiness and died so young that I was utterly bereaved."
"
#0531",college_women,"I saw a big house on top of a hill. It had great big glass windows with no curtains at the windows. As I went up the hill, I was wondering why there were no curtains. Then I went inside. There was a man (about middle-aged) who lived in this house. He was very ominous-looking. He had dark hair and a heavy mustache. Many young girls (about 20 years of age) lived in this house. The man seemed to dominate all the girls. He painted all the time. Maybe he used the girls as models. They would do whatever he said. The man reminded me of Orson Welles. The furniture in this house was oversized--extremely large. I disliked the man intensely."
"
#0542",college_women,"I was in New York sitting in on a radio broadcast with my aunt and cousin. The program was ""The Life of Riley."" The first part was very noisy and hilarious with people moving up and down the aisles. The last part was very solemn and serious. My seventeen year old cousin wanted to see the program over again so my aunt and he stayed. I went into the lobby of the hotel and bumped into a girl friend. I told her that we were to go out to dinner in an hour and if she wanted to we could go somewhere and talk. I ran through the long carpeted lobby up two stairs and tried to get into the studio to tell my aunt where I would be. The usher let me in but my girl friend kept following me asking me where I was going. I then woke up."
"
#0555",college_women,"I was trying to buy some records in a record shop, and I wanted to get the flat, black disks like everyone elses, but the man was trying to talk me into getting a disk that was in the shape of the wax that a dentist puts in your mouth when he wants to take an impression. This record was blue on one side and pink on the other side. I remember that the record fit into the victrola just as an impression fits into a person's mouth. I felt very nauseated. I insisted, however, upon the black, flat records, and finally bought them and walked out of the store."
"
#0558",college_women,"I was going to the H-- Theater with my brother and my Aunt R--. We didn't have any tickets so we were going to buy them when we got to the box office. There were two shows that night, the six o'clock show and the 8:30 show. My aunt and I wanted to go to the 6:oo show and my brother wanted to attend the 8:30 show. We argued for quite a while and then decided to each go our own way. My aunt and I then went to the ticket office to get the tickets, but there weren't any left for the six o'clock so we decided to wait for cancellations. The manager told us we were tenth in line waiting for cancellations. We waited and waited. At last, we decided it was futile, and we asked for tickets for the 8:30 show. However, there were none left for that show either. I felt very angry with my brother. I felt it was all his fault. I was brooding when my alarm went off."
"
#0564",college_women,I was walking up my street when I heard the wild barking of our dog. I shouted for him. I was very glad to see him bounding toward me with all his old vim and vigor. I said to myself that I knew he wasn't dead all the time. We played in the front yard. He barked just as loud as ever and looked black and shiny as before. I could hardly believe he was alive.
"
#0570",college_women,"I dreamt that our cleanlng woman, about 50, who has come into our home for many years, was late in finishing her work, because she was sharpening needles in order to listen to the records of the Roman Catholic Mass. I was helping her sharpen the needles, as I was worried that the woman was working overtime. I seem to remember that the time was 4:35 and her quitting time is 4:00. All through this dream, I had the feeling that time was running out, and that I had to hurry. My parents were around somewhere, too, but I don't remember anything else about them in connection with the dream."
"
#0574",college_women,"I dreamt that I was walking to a class through M-- arch and noticed that a funeral home was located at the same place that M-- House is actually. This place had large glass windows and looking in from the sidewalk where I was, I noticed that a funeral was just ending. The mourners were slowly advancing to the front of the room where the casket was displayed. The corpse was a fair-haired woman about 40 or so, dressed in a black gown. I never saw the face before. Some of the mourners were weeping as they approached the casket. I remembered to myself that I had never seen a dead person and was rather curious to see this one. That seems to be all."
"
#0575",college_women,"I remember being out on a date with another couple. I can't remember who my escort was or who the other girl was with. I know her rather casually, having once doubled with her several months back. She is about 20. We were sitting around a table at some restaurant or other. She asked me what type of man I wanted to marry. I proceeded to tell her and she asked me first of all what height I preferred in a man. I answered 5' 10 "". Then she asked about preferred hair coloring. I really had no preference but after she suggested dark hair I agreed that I too preferred men with dark hair. She intimated that she was tired of most of the men she knew, especially the tall, dark and handsome variety."
"
#0580",college_women,I dreamt that we bought a drug store on the west side. Next to our store was a grocery which had the sign --J-- C-- The store waslocated on a corner and there was an empty store right next to us. I had a temporary anxiety that another drug store would move in here. Someone assured me that this wasn't true. A C-- restaurant was located not far away from where we were. We were glad that a clean eating place was close at hand. My parents and I went there for a meal. That is all I remember.
"
#0583",college_women,"I dreamt that I was attending a class meeting of the senior class and we all were sitting in very even rows. I got up and tendered my resignation from the stunt nite chorus, that I am in. I told them I was too busy to take on all of the many hours of rehearsals ahead. They accepted my resignation. I felt just a trifle sorry for having backed out. I regretted this action quite strongly. Then I woke up--"
"
#0586",college_women,"I had been visiting my uncle's drug store and did not see my aunt, incidentally I haven't seen her in several years. Afterwards I came down to our drug store and shortly afterwards my uncle and aunt got off a streetcar and came to visit us. My aunt said she was very disappointed at not seeing me therefore had come down immediately. We had some sort of conversation in which she discussed her children when they were young."
"
#0594",college_women,"In my dream I was in the lobby of a hotel which I had stayed at in M -- B--, F--. I was just sitting there wondering how I had got there. Then people who had been staying at the hotel last winter when I was there came in and each one greeted me and asked when I had got there. I answered that I didn't know when or how I had gotten there. They didn't answer, but just walked away. I was left sitting there along wondering how I had got there. That is all I can remember of the dream."
"
#0597",college_women,"In my dream I pestered my mother until she allowed me to have contact lenses made. The first day I got them, I wore them and I was very happy with them. However, when I went to remove them, the glass in the left eye refused to budge. I struggled until I became very excited and frighten. My whole family tried to help me get it out, but they couldn't. Finally a doctor was called in, and he removed it, but he told me that I would be blind in that eye."
"
#0600",college_women,"In my dream I was riding in a large car. The driver was male and blond. That is all that I can remember about him. I was sitting next to him in the front seat and we were driving through the country. It seems to me we drove a very long time and then we came to a large body of water and we stopped at the edge. There was no bridge, and we couldn't get across so we just stayed at the edge of the water."
"
#0601",college_women,"I dreamt I was riding on a streetcar. A man got on the streetcar and sat down near me. He had an unusually long nose and I was fascinated by it. I simply stared at his nose until he rose to get off the streetcar. I was compelled to follow for some reason. I followed him for several blocks, but I lost him soon as it was dark. I remember nothing about the man except that he had a large nose."
"
#0606",college_women,"There was a rather large gathering of girls and boys, all college students in a living room. I didn't recognize the room at all and I didn't know all of the students. (I seemed to know the girls but very few boys.) We were all dressed in sports clothes or slacks, jeans & shirts. There was a phonograph playing. The boys then announced they were going to pick a queen. It was like a ""hot of the blue."" No one was prepared for it - it was a complete surprise. Nevertheless each of the girls had to take a turn encircling the room. After this announcement some other girls arrived on the scene nicely dressed in their good clothes. All this time I was sitting on the couch watching the others and I woke up before it was my turn to get up. I know I felt very mad when the alarm clock went off and woke me up. I had a feeling that I wanted to go back and find out what would have happened."
"
#0611",college_women,"I seem to have been entertaining in a beautiful large home. People were coming and going. I can't remember the details of the dream very well but I vividly remember that I was half beast and half woman. Everything my clothes did not cover was normal and therefore no one else knew the difference. However, sometime during the evening I must have taken off my dress because some of my guests looked at me in horror and left. The others seemed to accept the fact and the evening continued."
"
#0615",college_women,"Apparently J----, a very good friend of mine had just been married. There was a great gathering in what seemed to be the basement of a church. (Mine at home.) We were all waiting for the wedding party to arrive. Two tables had been set up and decorated with flowers. One table, for the wedding party and close friends, was very large. The other was quite small. I was there with a mutual friend of J--'s and mine (a girl). I was very much surprised to see a boy friend of my brothers come in and I went over to talk to him. (He is 2 yrs younger than I.) When the time came to sit down to supper this girl friend of mine and I sat down at the small table with him. Then the bride's mother asked J-- and I to come over to the other table. I was very anxious to go over to that table but when we were seated over there I felt so guilty about leaving the boy. I kept looking back to see how he was getting on all the time because he didn't know the other people. I felt sort of like a heel walking out on him. The wedding party never did show up and everyone went on eating."

#0638",college_women,"I was in a crowded elevator with some people I know & some strangers - I don't know how it happened but I suddenly knew my father was dying behind me - he was being carried in somebody's arms, & I knew I mustn't turn around to look or I'd never forget it, but I took one quick look - he was blue & gasping, it didn't look like my father, but I knew it was he. & I looked quickly away. We got to the floor we got out on - by then he was dead. The man holding my father said, ""Take him"" - I was terribly afraid even to look at him, & I was afraid that the people in the elevator would notice. I heard a voice proclaiming down the hall (the hall was wide, bare, & echoing - like a hospital). ""Wait - wait for S---- H----! "" but I knew it was really S---- A---. He ran quickly toward the elevator, but the doors closed & we moved down. But what was lying in my arms (to my surprise) was a large sawdust dummy with an ugly papier mache face. No one noticed anything - the dream faded out."
"
#0645",college_women,"All I remember is a fragment - I was looking on at myself - that is, I knew I was dreaming a dream in which I was participant. The scene was a bare hospital ward--my younger brother was lying on a high wheeled hospital cot under an oxygen tent--terribly thin & with his face all eyes and shadows, & trying to smile while I read to him."
"
#0647",college_women,"I was in the kitchen--company was coming or there was some important reason for success with an elaborate meal, which I was to make. Ever time I went for an ingredient I needed, I discovered we had none. At my wits end I settled on ""tuna-fish souffle"" & some concoction of mixed vegetables. There were other things, because I kept dashing from one to the other. The souffle got done too soon, & began to dry out & to fall--the sauce for the vegetables bubbled over & then began to evaporate before my eyes--that's all I remember."

Suddenly the scene changed and we were sitting in the car at town watching the people go by. However, they were people from my hometown and not from my grandmother's town. I saw my best girlfriend (age 22) walking by with my high school history teacher (about 40). They stopped to talk, and thats the last I remember."

#0673",college_women,I dreamed that I was in a country store in a town I had never seen before. I saw a girl in the front of the store crying. I went up to her and asked her what I could do to help. She saw a small suitcase I was holding and said she would like it. I gave her the suitcase and a small amount of money. She thanked me and walked out of the store. The next day I read in the newspaper that I would be called to the police station for questioning. The girl whom I had helped had been mutilated by a hatchet and my suitcase had been found near her dead body.

So, I remember next that someone was washing my hair, it turned out to be a girl I didn't like who went to my Church. I didn't dry my hair but went walking around the auditorium with wet hair."
"
#0681",college_women,"I dreamed that my whole family was killed in a train accident. I was stunned when I read in the newspapers of the great tragedy. On the front page there was a picture of me in a state of sorrow. I received many calls from people who wanted to help me and the whole city was in sympathy with me. Everyone was feeling sorry for me, including the people whom I didn't particularly like."

#0001",vietnam_vet,"I'm in Honduras at some kind of border crossing. A wide corridor of thick fenced scrub is off on either side.. Everything is grim, sinister, ominous. A few peasants silently plod up or down the hilly earth. It's a miserable, gloomy place. Everything feels cloaked in darkness. I try going forward, but after a time, something says ""Danger, turn back."" Not taking the winding paths, I trudge up the steep hills, making the work twice as hard, like my first treks in Guatemala in 1992. At a hilltop, I begin to choke for air. I make gasping sounds, I'm suffocating, dying"

#0003",vietnam_vet,"I'm part of a bomber crew flying over a European or Balkan city. We're flying low, 200-300 feet off the ground. At a designated signal, the bombs are dropped over a wooded, jungle-like area. As we fly over the dense forest, I can partially see the smoke and flames through the aircraft's small windows. I hear the bombs exploding. The bomber crew ""ooohs and aaahs"" enthusiastically. The scene changes. I'm hanging from the first story of a large brick building. Across the street, about 100 meters away, another man, much higher up, is doing the same. Through my pants, I feel and then see a long swollen welt, like a large worm, or engorged leech, attached to my thigh. I'm bleeding. I shout to the men in the plane overhead, ""Hey, fella's, I'm hit!"" My shout alerts the enemy. The other dangling man drops to the ground. It's a long fall. He's likely dead. I drop to the ground. In an alley, I run to a large wooden barn door, painted Army green. Is it locked? I manage to push or slide it open it as a blond muscular man chases me. I enter the building, a large and empty warehouse-like room, with tall ceilings and a smooth cement floor. The blond man rushes in. I try to escape but he captures me. Moments later, four or five other men, storm into the room. Dressed in great coats they perform a dazzling display of martial arts. Then it's over. I'm a POW. There's no escape"

My area has a bookcase, which is organized and neat, but all around me are the clothes and Christmas decorations that belong to someone else. A roommate comes by. I ask him, ""Who owns this stuff?"" He comes too close; I fear he will fall on me and harm my hernias. Dogs appear. One has my right wrist in its jaws. The other has my legs in its mouth. I can't see them, but hear and feel their growls, the touch of their teeth. I yell, ""Stop! Stop it!"" several times, each time louder than the next. The dogs aren't vicious. They appear to be playing. But I have fear. I'm yelling, ""Stop it!"

There's a dance or social function taking place. I'm with another man, a friend or acquaintance. I'm wearing very colorful jeans, clothing I would not ordinarily wear. I begin talking to an attractive woman with short blonde hair. She remarks about the jeans. I say, ""I saw them and had to buy them."" A criminal-like man enters the room through its glass doors. He is unctuous, intimidating. At one point he socializes with us, then becomes angry at my friend, lifting him up, almost fighting him. My friend owes him a gambling debt. I intervene, telling the intruder to leave. He backs off, appears to go, but loiters outside, before slinking back to the glass door. I walk over to him. In the doorway, I say, ""I'm warning you. I'm going to hurt you."" He leaves, but not for long. The woman has left. I want to find her, and go outside. It's beautiful here. I'm relaxed"

#0012",vietnam_vet,"I'm in a room with other Vietnam vets. We're young, in our late 20s or 30s. The plan is to meet here weekly. I'm talking with one of the vets. I say, ""We can share a ride. I'll pay for gas if you have a car."" I don't tell him I don't drive. Another vet, who seems familiar, who is robust and mature, asks about my dog tags, which I'm wearing around my neck. Happily, I tell him, ""I'm wearing them because of today."" The other vet immediately chokes up and turns away. I know enough to refrain from speaking"
"
#0013",vietnam_vet,"I'm working in an office and meet a mature girl at a nearby bakery. She's very pretty, friendly and kind. I buy bread from her and forget to leave a tip. Then I do, at first counting out the small change, then giving all the coins to her. ""Just take it all,"" I say. Dave, a best friend since college, meets her. She must choose between him or me. She prefers me. It's because of my fine body, she says. I introduce to the girl to my grandfather. ""This is my grandfather,"" I say, momentarily forgetting his name. He introduces himself. The girl says she likes movies, plays and museums. My grandfather gives her subway directions to New York's theater district. The girl is anxious. I tell her we'll find it. At night, she and I walk down a country road. I tell her I know this road. I know where it leads. I point out its center lines, now faded, barely recognizable, as if paint sprayed from a distance. The scene changes. We're in a pup tent. Something is wrong. The girl complains; the tent is missing stakes, rope and the poles to keep it upright and taut. And there's no ground mat; only the bare earth. And the weather is bad. There is tension. Dave, or whoever gave us the tent, is at fault"
"
#0023",vietnam_vet,"I'm on my way to the apartment building of a girl I've just met. I see a man I know. He's young, handsome, dark haired, possibly of Indian decent. I tell him, ""I'm going to see if I left my coat at her house."" I tell him that if I find it, we should get together. If not, I'll go home. He cheerfully says, ""Now I feel good,"" or ""That makes me feel good."" I don't understand why he said that. I go to the floor where the girl lives but can't recall her door. I enter an apartment, a bar, and sit on a stool. A stocky man, wearing a suite and tie, with 1950s swept back duck's-ass hair, taps my shoulder. When I get up, he takes my seat. I say, ""I was sitting there,"" but he ignores me. I push him off the seat and he falls to the floor. I say, ""C'mon, let's fight."" Dazed, he stands up, crouches and puts up his fists. This surprises me. Not showing my fear, I say, ""No, no. I don't want to fight. Look, I was sitting there."

#0035",vietnam_vet,"I'm in a beautiful landscape. A child's fantasy of armored knights in battle. Two knights on immense horses swing swords, one clearly outdoing the other. I witness a skilled knight who rides to the rescue of the man being defeated. The large swords swing and clash. When the rescuing knight is about to deliver the coup de grace, I turn to the physician Susan G, who is dressed as a princess, and say, ""He's about to do a podcast."" She compliments me for a witty joke or phrase I did not make. It's so modern, so witty, she says. In that moment I decide to let the oversight pass"

#0041",vietnam_vet,"It's windy. I'm climbing in an open pit mine of gray white stone that is similar to granite. White dust fills the air. I climb over the terraced ledges to a Spanish-like plaza where there is shelter from the wind and a place to eat. I sit at a table with a young boy and an old woman. When they leave I realize they've stolen my daypack and baseball cap. The pack contains nothing of value, but it's mine. I can't believe they've stolen it. I run after them. Then I lean forward and fly. I'm about ten feet off the ground, flying down a blacktop country road that winds through a wide-open town. I fly past shops, past a few people on the road, past a woman on a bicycle, past a large store selling plants and flowers. Has my pack been stolen, or is this a dream"

#0045",vietnam_vet,"I'm in my old house on Highland Place. Outside, it's raining hard. After the storm, I enter the bathroom to find that one window has a chipped corner, the window screens have been blown out; the room is wrecked. I go to the backyard to retrieve the screens and reinstall them. My mother joins me. To hook the oblong screens on prongs at the top of the window casement requires skill. When my mother succeeds, she says, ""I did it!"" in her hapless way. I tell her the windows are old. I tell her the landlord should replace them. I tell her she doesn't know the law, and mention the law of habitability. My mother doesn't want to hear about it. She doesn't want the trouble. I wake up saying, ""They really should be replaced."

#0046",vietnam_vet,"It's a bright sunny day. As an adult, I'm attending a ceremony on a grassy hill at my grammar school. I'm wearing a jacket and tie and talking with a friend. A casually dressed obese young man with long frizzy hair approaches me. ""This is for you,"" he says. He hands me a two-foot strand of thickly woven cord, one end of which is unraveling. I put on my sunglasses. It's time to say the Pledge of Allegiance. I will stand without reciting the words or placing my hand over my heart. I'm thinking, if anyone asks or bothers me I'll say, ""I know what war is and none of this is true."" Afterward, as the frizzy haired man and I walk across a hilly lawn, he asks, ""Why do you have so many banks?"" I say, ""How do you know?"" He says, ""I just know."" I say, ""I have four banks. So what?"" We enter the school and walk to a room near a staircase. The frizzy haired man hands me a textbook. ""This is for Miss Tonner's class,"" he says. He makes sure it's the right book, the right class. There is something about the books texture and heft; its grim bulky cover which resembles a film negative. I don't want it, but to avoid conflict, I say nothing. Back on the lawn, I tell my friend about the question I was asked. I wake up saying, ""I have four banks. So what?"

#0050",vietnam_vet,"I'm young. With my dog, I'm part of a small group walking a country trail. We pass a group of people. Far in the distance I see my former girlfriend Karen. I want to be with her but we have to keep moving. I wave to her regretfully. Does she understand? As we walk, a man leads a reluctantly trotting pony with rope tethered around its body. There's been a car accident. Many possessions are lined up on the side of the trail. Concerned men stand about. We keep moving and, finally arrive at a large one-story house with white adobe walls and dirt floors. It's more like a barn or large hut. Inside, I talk with Lewis, the younger brother of a college best friend. I say, ""It's pretty simple here. Almost like a college dorm."" Lewis says, ""Yeah, I guess so."" I don't like this place. It's too casual. I want order. I want things to be orderly and clean. I'll have to get used to this. My dog runs through the house. She's playful yet nervous. There's a small pile of pot on Lewis's bed. She runs over the pot, disturbing it. She drinks water. I ask Lewis if he can deal with the dog. I tell him she's my dog. I wake up talking"

#0066",vietnam_vet,"I'm in a play being performed in a small darkened theater. Only a few people are in the audience. The subject is the war on drugs. I play a general in charge of a half-dozen guerillas, shouting out rhetorical questions to inspire my men. ""Are we going to fight this war?! Are we going to win this battle?!"" I'm doing this for their sake and to excite the audience. At first the guerrillas are unenthusiastic, but the second time I rouse them they are more high-spirited. ""Who's going to fight this war?"" I yell. ""We are!"" they shout back. ""We're going to war!"" I yell. "" Let's kill some of those bad people!"

#0068",vietnam_vet,"My former girlfriend Karen and I spend the night together. It's been so long. We undress and make love. In the morning, we look for a train back to the town I lived in from 2001 to 2012. At the station Karen is sure of the way, but enters and exits twice. Without thinking, she blocks the way of a waiting passenger, a mysterious man. A train arrives but we miss it and walk in the country. Karen stands high up on a dirt ridge while I'm on lower ground. In the distance, I see a man who appears to be armed. Is he a cop? When the man turns, I see it's a shotgun, not a pistol, he's hidden inside his long tan coat. The man is angry. Karen, who does not see him, drinks water from a paper cup, and throws the empty cup down the ridge. I loudly whisper her name to warn her but she doesn't hear me calling. The man walks toward Karen, bumps into her, pushes her. I'm angry and start walking toward him. I will kick this man in his throat"

#0069",vietnam_vet,"It's night. I'm with a platoon of American soldiers in Vietnam. Instead of jungle, we're in an urban area with many tall apartment buildings similar to Sycamore Hill, the apartment complex I lived in from 10 to 12 years of age. Entering a complex, I struggle to sling on my pack, which is made of many fibers, like a humming's nest. We're making too much noise; the Vietnamese know the American' are here. The platoon enters a building and splits up. I'm alone, running down empty hallways, peering into apartments. I fear being seen or shot by the blue-collar inhabitants. In some rooms, the lights are on, or the doors are open. It's as if no one's home, or no one cares to be safe. I've had enough, and skip down the cement stairwells two steps at a time, triggering an alarm. At one of the landings, I see Ba repairing a water leak in the hotel he ran in ?Vietnam in the 1990s. I make a remark as I jump past. Ba says, ""Did you ask the officer about hunting?"" I wake up saying, ""I forgot. What do you want me to say?"

#0072",vietnam_vet,"I'm sitting in an English garden with Donald Trump and his family. Trump is upbeat, arrogant. The scene changes. Trump enters an upscale private first floor lounge occupied by hotel staff. The tent-like roof raises to allow views of the stylish hotel grounds. I'm seated next to Trump, who is standing and sullen. A corpse in a coffin is carried into the room. One at a time, I share hors d'oeuvres with Trump, who scoffs at the body. The scene changes. Trump and I sit on the floor of the hotel's first floor utility closet; his family is the roof. It's dark in here. I'm holding Trump's hand, which is shaped like a wooden spoon. I ask Trump if he's afraid. He says that earlier he'd done building repairs and now wants to leave, but first, he must tell his family. I say, ""I'll call them."" Trump wonders if their phones will ring. I tell him at least one of the phones will get the call"

#0073",vietnam_vet,"It's dark and raining. I'm flying through an area similar to Green Meadow Lake, where my grandparents had a summer home in the 50s, looking into the lights windows of houses as I soar past. I enter an empty house much like the one my grandparents owned here, settle in, trying not to make noise. Very soon someone bangs on the back door. ""Hello!...hello!"" they call out. For a few minutes I ignore them, hoping they'll leave. Finally, knowing I've been caught, I walk through the darkened house and answer the door. Out back, there's a cab waiting with passengers. The driver and a woman passenger hand me items that have fallen out of a toiletry kit which I had earlier left in the cab. The driver is almost apologetic. I thank him for returning my things. Waking, I say, ""Thanks."

#0077",vietnam_vet,"I'm living in a ramshackle rooming house. It's seedy and flea bitten. Someone has stolen my bed blanket. Reluctantly, I enter the room of two black brothers to ask if they've seen it. The two men lie face down on the floor and appear to be dead. Their beds are unmade. Dirty clothes and garbage are everywhere. The blanket is not here. The scene changes. I'm standing in a large foyer, much like the one at the Brand Theater where I worked in 1972 as an usher. In a thick British accent, an older Englishman with a 1950s haircut peppers me with questions. ""Do you have a cigarette? Do you have a light?"" On and on he goes. Whenever he speaks, he lurches forward suddenly, causing me to flinch. Is he drunk? ""Do you have coffee?"" he asks. "" Imitating Richard Burton in a scene from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, I say, ""Coffee? Coffee? How do you like your coffee?"" The landlord arrives. I point the Englishman toward him. ""This man would like to speak to you,"" I say"

I imagine he is resigned to being ignored, but no, he is firm and confident, has studied hard, recites the answers well, and takes the controls with authority. An older heavy set professor and I will test a short woman pilot who resembles one of my neighbors. After she completes the written exam, the professor, who is Southern and gruff, tells her that's all, she may go. Instead of leaving, the woman insists on knowing how she has done. This upsets the professor. Siding with the woman pilot, I press the question. Waking, I say, ""Doctor, what is the problem? I mean, isn't it the right thing to do?"

A vet calls asking about freebies offered by stores, restaurants, and hotels, for veterans over sixty. A seated worker handling the call asks me for info. I tell him the vet should dial the VA 800 number. He ignores my advice. I talk to another worker, who is staring at the yellow wall inches from his face. I talk with Vincent B. The seated worker taunts him by saying ""Dick...dick...dick."" I want to show them my .45 pistol, which I have in my pack, but this would cause fear. I imagine the guards at the metal detectors.

After a man has asked his question, an officer loudly repeats it, the inmate answers, and the process is repeated. The men ask banal questions. The answers are equally predictable. It is all done quickly. I know that the man being questioned has committed arson. At my turn, I ask him, ""Did the crime you committed put you or anyone else in danger? If so, what did you do, and why did you do it?"" The other prisoners grumble. His tone is mocking as the prisoner says this is the best question, and he is asked it often. Sneering, an inmate asks me, ""What about you? What did you do?"" My provocative answer has put me in danger. Later these men will try to attack me. I imagine the warden will put me elsewhere in the prison. My crime was to throw hand grenades into barrels of shit"

We're about to start when a distraught young man, bearded and with black hair, approaches. He asks if I have any problems, then launches into a forceful series of mixed up questions. Clearly, he's mentally ill. At first, I'm patient with him. Then firmly, I say, ""No. I'm not interested, sir. Stop."" Holding up my hand, I say, ""Just stop."" My brother envies my self-assertion. When the man departs, I ask my brother where he wants to begin work. Here, or at another desk? He's ambivalent. I take charge"

With a friend, I walk to a store in an area much like a famous amusement park. The man in front of me buys a lotto ticket. I hear the numbers he's playing and write them down.

When they are face to face, with violence imminent, they kiss passionately. To give them privacy, I move, bumping up against another woman's arms or legs. Jokingly, I say to her, ""What was that? Oh, that's better. Much better. Thank you so much, whoever you are."" The first woman and I walk across the street. She's wearing blue slacks. Her straight black hair covers her forehead; like an ancient helmet, it protects each side of her face. As we cross the street she says, ""Oh, I know you.""

Python or octopus-like, it slowly pins me down, though I manage to break free. The second time, I wake, moaning. In another room, I ask a young American man about fireworks. He introduces me to a Thai woman, a former opera singer. She steps to a wall and begins to sing a low mournful song. The other rooms are a succession of tents made of light blue cloth in the jungle. It begins to rain. I wonder what it's like to stay dry in the tents, where the water is absorbed by the cloth"

He asks what I'm doing here. I tell him I'm just about to put on my clothes and leave. Outside, on a hill overlooking a large field of dry grass, a young white man yells at his tan dog to obey his commands. After putting its paws on the man's head, the dog whimpers.

But the person does not fall, and the four of us run in the rain up a hill toward a shelter. Reaching a patch of dry, bleached earth, I set the animal down to walk on it's own. But the animal, sick, or weak, or afraid, does not move; after cries and whimpers, it talks to me. With deep feeling I say, ""I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm sorry. What can I do?""

As the plane speeds forward, the first bombs disappear from view, as if headed off course. They reappear, falling faster, closer to earth, narrowing on their targets. Suddenly, hundreds of bombs begin to explode and the paddies light up like a fireworks display. But instead of bursts of orange flames and black smoke, or circular shock waves and smoke filled craters, on the grid of tiny squares the destruction is simulated in bright pastels of blue and green. Somehow, I hear the shrieks and chaos as the peasants and villages are engulfed in flames.

""You have to express your feelings,"" I say to her. ""If it's just the facts, people get bored."" The scene changes. I'm riding with three or four people on a small yellow school bus. I'm aware that an old woman with white hair, petite, thin and fragile, excites me. She has a speech impediment, and seems disabled. We don't speak. After a time the driver pulls to the side of the road. We have to wait, he says. This is a charter bus, and according his contract, during civil rights demonstrations he cannot drive. As he speaks, I point to the passing cars and trucks. I tell him there are no demonstrations, and that not driving makes no sense. The driver exits the vehicle to buy items at a candy store under an elevated subway across the street. I exit the bus, cross the street and peek in the shop window. An attractive woman, wearing a flouncy dress, begins dancing to 1960s pop music with a man in a black suit, white shirt and bow tie. The woman is hectic and ungraceful. Back in the bus, the driver gives a weak excuse for why we can now go on our way. Before he left, I said I would get off and find a local bus, and imagined a long arduous journey"

Phyllis R enters my room, maker her way to the bed, then suddenly pounces on top of me.[105] I push her away and scold her. She's incensed and wants to leave. I tell her, ""It's all about the tease, Phil. It's all about the tease."" Hovering over me in her loose fitting pajamas, she decides to stay. We begin to neck and slip off our clothes. A nurse enters and leaves the room. I ask, ""Do we have privacy?"" Phyllis says no, but at the hospital where she works, in an hour a room will be available. A woman is having an operation there. She's read the plans. Preparing to make love, I kneel behind Phyllis as she presents her derriere. We've abandoned privacy"

The woman is fashionably dressed, her hair is formally styled. She reads a magazine article about food and tells her husband the names of restaurants which cook and present meals to her liking. Inadvertently I put the Vietnam profile on the mans swept back and neatly combed hair. Immediately I remove it, but say nothing. I hope he's seen it. I hope he's seen that I'm a Vietnam vet"

For World War II, we are pressed up against an earthworks. Just before a shell hits, there is a faint clicking sound. A drop in air pressure. A long thin piece of shrapnel lodges in a makeshift shield I hold in front of me. The same noise and air change precede the second shell. The moments before the blast take forever. The shell explodes to my right. So close I barely hear it. There is a brightness. A soft surrounding thud. I check to see how bad I'm hit"

I start again, with a dream which has the word Jamestown in its title. Someone comments, and the head doctor gets up and chastises that person. I begin a third time, am interrupted, and this time the doctor throws the offender out. As I start a fourth time, a bespectacled man, a former highschool student named Pat, assisted by a black swagger stick topped with a gold crown ,walks down the aisle toward me, asking an irrelevant question"

The officer listens patiently but insists I obey his orders. As we talk, periodically a man being chased runs by. I say, ""Who was that?"" Finally, I agree to the task, but repeat my demands. The officer accepts. Waking, I say, ""I would like to do that but will have to prepare my uniform."

Suddenly a stocky young man with thinning blonde hair, scar, and wearing white food service garb, enters the room and rudely criticizes my remarks.

In fact, the calendar consists of square numbered sheets, one for each day of the year, all hand made, of high quality, as is the artisanal cardboard box. I turn to Edward and ask him about the source of the materials, hoping they don't pollute. An individual resembling Ernest Hemingway, who misconstrues my question, says the calendar merchant is a pilot.

One of two in the area, built of long horizontally placed rectangular panels of unfinished wood, the front of the house is broad, high and flat, and without windows. We enter, climb a steep narrow staircase (I have locked the door with a small hook and eye, and a button device), which leads to a small narrow bedroom very similar to those at the guest house in Guatemala I often visited. A young black girl, seven or eight years old, with a large Afro, and who is precocious, lies awake in bed. I ask her name. She tells me it's ""Syria."" I try to think of other Mideast countries to call her, but only Jordan comes to mind. So much for attempting humor. Sitting near her, I try to play a simple stringed musical instrument, but with little success. Outside the house, amongst a small crowd, I duel with a superb athlete dressed as a Greek or Roman warrior. Armed with unpointed spears--he has already broken mine in half--with incredible agility, he evades, parries and defeats all my attacks. Finally, I defeat him, and he turns into a water bug that I chase after, hitting it with my spear, forcing it to crawl into a piece of clear plastic membrane at the edge of the house, which leads to the basement.

A tall distinguished looking black man, wearing a suit and tie, his demeanor is similar to Morgan Freeman.[152] As we descend the long staircase, he says, ""And now for the next event.""

The machine gun may jam but I concentrate on sweeping the bullets from left to right, cutting the enemy down. Fifty yards ahead, crawling forward, a man with a black mini-gun. I shoot a burst that topples him. Another burst, he is not dead but writhing, severely wounded. A young man on our side, dressed as a civilian, appears on my left. Tall, powerfully built, with thick black hair, and wearing a white shirt and black pants, he is relaxed, confident. I continue firing across the landscape, not caring if the people are civilians or soldiers. In fact, I like what I'm doing. I'm shooting people. Killing them.

One, two or three weeks at a time he can take it wherever he likes. We arrive at a summer village, which the girl belongs to. Several times, as we walk down a dirt path bordered by chicken wire, I ask if the area is safe. The girl assures me it is, and points out several dark green wooden rowboats tied up to the shore. With these, we can take lessons in a specific rowboat technique. When we sleep next to each other, we talk, and several times I choke up. It's the war. I'm thinking how awful things can get, but I do not tell her that's what bothers me. When we arrive at a busy amusement park there are people crowded by entrance.

It's a long way to the other side of the school. Being on the team requires practicing three times per week. I'd rather go home and watch TV"

#0379",vietnam_vet,"An agreement has been reached between the residents of a village and the occupying Germany army. Without fear of retaliation, the citizens can approach a German soldier and say whatever they like. A pretty young girl walks up to a soldier who wears a high ranking officers cap and cape. She begins to read from a prepared statement, though first saying to loudly to herself, ""Go, Rachel. You can do this."" Moments into her statement, the German tells her to stop, which causes the villagers to boo and jeer. The scene changes. It's night, raining. There is lightning. Rachel is seated in an alcove similar to 39 Ivy Street. There is the heavy rounded top wood front door; in it, or the walk-in closet outer wall, the small round window. I tell Rachel, for her age strikingly mature and intelligent, that she had fallen asleep, that several hours have passed. She believes me. There, I've done it. I've fooled this impetuous little girl. But I'll have to tell her the truth"

#0382",vietnam_vet,"In Switzerland, I've found my fifth-grade teacher at my grammar school. She gives me food, allows me to sleep on the wood parquet floor of the little apartment she shares with a friend. I'm as quiet as possible. Alone in the apartment, we talk. It's Kara. It really is. With her long brown hair and her warm sad face, she is still beautiful. As we lie on the floor, she allows me to press myself upon her to kiss her. We talk about the monthly VA check I had signed over to her. She still receives it; $244 per month. What to do? Kara and her friend do not make much money. About $1200 per month. But what about me? And what if the VA finds out? We talk about helicopters. How to co-ordinate the flights so we can continue to meet"

#0383",vietnam_vet,"At a large and grim college I enter a twilit room. On my bookcase, in a light green plastic bag, someone has left two books. Who is here? I follow a drunk male student and sit with him on a couch. The student is friendly, harmless; when he shifts his body, I see that he's sat on his brown potato chips. Leaving the room, in a high walled dungeon like corridor, I meet a good-looking middle aged brunette. Though I'm immediately attracted to her, she is wary; she thinks I'm following her. ""Excuse me, Miss. Can I ask you a question?"" Happily, she says, ""Yes."" I ask, ""Are you single?"" She is, and even before I ask her out, my mood, voice and demeanor reflect my abundant well-being. I ask, smiling, laughing gently, ""Would you like to have coffee with me?"" She agrees, but we must hurry to where she must go, and race down the corridor, where momentarily I lose sight of her. After looking left and right, outside, down a narrow garden-like path that leads to the street, in the distance I see several women, but not her. I turn back, slide down a steep wet cement embankment that leads to an enormous mediaeval double door made of wood. I hammer my fists upon it. It's no use. She's gone"

G has given us instructions.[207] We'll break for a few minutes, then return for the photo. From the corner of my eye, I catch sight of Pete C walking up a narrow staircase.[208] I tell G I want a pistol, not a rifle. He motions me to a small square bedroom, furnished only with a large bed topped with white sheets, a dark wood antique chest of drawers. So this is where it happens.[209] G hands me a slim black and white antique catalog. He tells me to choose a weapon, but the solid black pistols look more like beetle specimens than hand guns. ""It doesn't matter,"" I tell him, ""but next time, I want a sheriffs badge."" Enthusiastically, I say, ""Yeah, I'll be a sheriff."" We enjoy this clever funny thought but without laughter. Back in the living room I re-join the uniformed men; crowded together, they instinctively point their rifles in the air"

To them both I say, ""Oh shit, I'm having a memory slip!"" At last, I say, ""My former girlfriend Karen, this is Donald Trump."" He shakes our hands.

When I yell or shout, my voice is stunted, weak. At the corridor's end, I enter a dark apartment living room. Mockingly, I ask ""How is everyone?"" It's a scene out of a concentration camp. Even in darkness, I see corpses stacked everywhere. A girl wearing a surgical mask approaches. I know this girl. She is somehow infected. I don't want to be near her. I try to push her down dark steps. As we struggle, she attempts to bite my hand, to lead me to others, to her parents. I resist. I don't want this. No. I don't want it"

I want this food, but order something simpler. When I'm done I spread a paper towel upon the table; with another, I wipe my mouth. My waitress, who resembles Sophia Loren and Ester Greenspan, has laid her arm upon the table.[211] Her open hand awaits the napkin but I simply don't see it. The waitress is smiling at me. A brief exchange. Is she happy and good natured? Or are we flirting? I really like this woman. I would like to ask her out"

When she goes to a kitchen cupboard for something to eat, to freshen my breath, I tear off a fragment from a large cake coated with chocolate. But the cake is not chocolate and I'm disappointed. My friends wife reaches into a shelf for a bag of rolls. As she stands on a cobblestone floor, she stumbles, nearly falls, climbs to a small cubby atop the cupboard. From there she watches a kitten repeatedly jump at me, claw its way up my sport jacket, like a stubborn goat bang its head into me, bite me, fall to the floor. This happens several times. The biting becomes vicious, painful, causing me to struggle, to yell, ""Stop! Stop!"

I'm about to go up a narrow stairway when the other man, on the second floor, tells me, ""There's nothing here."" After looking about, outside we find more wood products, and spread upon the ground like skeletons, yokes and harnesses made of thick plastic rope, likely worn by slaves. In a dank workshop basement a man describes a Vietnam vet who drove USO girls to various rear bases.[214] He says we knew this man, and shows me his tarnished medallion, the words inscribed upon it illegible. We leave the workshop to walk through a village, where I meet, or imagine meeting Ba. I ask Ba what the Vietnamese do upon finding the remains of their war dead. It must still happen.

""Here, babe,"" says Michelle, offering me a joint. But I don't want it, or her, and passive aggressively sit by the dog. After saying hello, a thin young man with unruly black hair, who might be Mike E, says, ""I heard you weren't feeling well.""[216] ""That was something else,"" I tell him. ""This is different."" ""I think you're a cop,"" he says. He's lying but wants me killed. Concealing my fear, I tell him, ""That's your perception, pal."" I have to leave this place. These people want to kill me.

In my good mood I hold a pretzel up to the running dogs, which run and jump for it. But the pretzel is too salty. I withhold it. Further on, I pass a tall brick building. From an upper floor, two boys throw water bombs which land not from me. I look up. A horses head and long neck hang from an open window. I imagine calling the police. It's hot. I take off my beige canvas pants, leave them on the sidewalk, go on my way. Near the military-like water front I'm aware there's a choice to decide. Take the ferry or continue on foot. I'll walk. Suddenly I realize I'm wearing only a T shirt and underwear; my phone, keys and wallet are in my pants. Panicked, I head back to Highland Place. On the sidewalk I see a large heavy cart, and push it along. When it gains speed I'll hop on; the carts momentum will power the trip. But the cart belongs to a building contractor who's searching for tools inside his VW van. I stop the cart just in time. A collision would have crumpled the VW's side door or fender. I continue walking. My pants might still be there. Or someone may have rifled the pockets. I mull over cancelling my credit cards, replacing my phone and keys"

The woman runs toward us, trying to calm the bear, which verges on play and attack. At the last possible moment, the beast slides to the ground; I begin petting it.

He seems dead, then starts to breathe. ""I'm sick,"" he says. I yell to the audience, ""Call the police! Is there a doctor here? Call the police!"" Someone yells, ""I'm trying.

Finally, the father a tall distinguished man, his leathery face a warren of crags and valleys, towers over me, holds me gently to his chest. At parting, in a jocular way, he says he will contact me about his next protest action, at a jail. Waking, with deliberation I say, ""Thank you for dropping by."

#0421",vietnam_vet,"I'm in Rowley, where Hilary Clinton went to college; I keep expecting to see her. In a large empty classroom, on a wide desk, I set up my computers: an old Apple desktop, its boxy monitor, my HP laptop. I want to view porn but students arrive. I have to pee. Returning from the bathroom, I find the desk empty. Is this the right room? I search several nearly identical classrooms. I should have known better. My wallet, the computers and peripherals, my flip phone are gone. I'll feel angry later. Right now I'm disappointed in myself. I should file a police report, and contact the credit card companies, but without their 800 numbers I'll have to call a friend to avoid the 411 fee. Walking through cavernous halls similar to New York's 42nd Street subway station, with its circus like gaudy stores, long grim passages, I ask a student for directions. Go straight, he says, then left. In a cramped stairway I struggle to climb over a pastel painted bannister. An sickly looking old man helps me, but several times grabs my crotch. What's wrong with him? Where are his boundaries? Finally I meet two male students. ""And they got the Iron Key, too,"" I tell them. ""What's that?"" asks the handsome boy with long dark blonde hair. ""It's an encrypted thumb drive."" ""Oh,"" he says, ""you really have to be good to have one of those."" I tell him I'm not technically savvy, but as we walk through a dark blasted landscape, littered with debris, he doesn't hear what I've said. ""Why would anyone at this school steal my computers?""

Do that three or four times. Rest twenty seconds. Do it again."" The fearful FNG listens to my every word. The scene changes. Pointman Larry Roy and I walk through the base, a grim desolate wasteland of battle worn equipment, forlorn bunkers, upturned earth. As in life, Larry is talkative, energetic.

We pass a REMF bunker with a private latrine.[219] I say, ""I need to use this place."" ""Sure,"" says Larry, as we enter, ""we can keep talking."" There are two toilets either end of the decrepit latrine. I take the near one. Larry sits on the other, twenty-five meters away.

My brother says that a man he knows has killed two men, and that he is emotionally distraught. I want to know more, but my brother won't tell me. The scene changes. It's dark. I'm near an enormous black dumpster, where an amorphous black creature, partly obscured, tries to attack me. I trap the creature inside the dumpster, and lock shut the heavy metal door. As the creature rails and struggles to escape, gleefully, I yell, ""You can't get out! You can't get out!"" But the creature manages to climb half way out, and we begin grappling.

My dog saunters into the room, hopes up onto the bed, sheltering herself f in my arms. I talk to her, asking her what she wants. Outside, it's raining, stormy. When I open the door to my mother's room, I behold an extraordinary sight. In place of the white walled cubicle, with its triple window pane, compact twin bed, the little faux antique desk and ice cream parlor chair, the brown veneer bureau, there is instead a great dark hall, filled with exotic furnishings, foreign curios, fine costly rugs, travel souvenirs from around the world. Close by, completely still, with a towel or white cloth or veil covering his head, my brother sits quite and erect in a wing back chair. I look at the round clock high up on the wall. I say to my brother, ""Dave, it's nearly 2am, and she's not here."" ""Don't worry,"" he says, ""She'll be here."

We decide to return to the hotel, but she will meet me there. After waiting in the spartan adobe-like room, with its sharp angles and perfect shadows, I grow impatient and leave. Careful not to be seen, I walk through a sun drenched adobe walled alley bordered by shrubs and trees, which leads to a verdant field. I levitate, at first rising inch by inch off the ground. Finally, gaining speed and height, I'm flying, following the path of railroad tracks a hundred feet below. In the distance, coming towards me, a train locomotive shaped like the fuselage of a C-123 cargo plane.[220] There is the roar of its mighty prop and jet engines, the sight of the immense black sphere painted on its nose. As we rush toward each other I let out a whoop of joy. Somehow, we do not collide. Once home, upon opening the door to my apartment, a grim, low ceilinged prison-like cell, I find my bed, nearly all my possessions, are gone. Where will I sleep? I'll have to buy a new futon. As well, the toilet has flushed all this time. Filthy water fills the deep ruts in the equally filthy cement floor. I walk out and enter the next door apartment. Windowless, but roomy, with a broad parquet floor, a spacious white painted bookcase, pastel painted walls, it resembles my Brooklyn apartment. A stocky light-skinned black man, his back toward me, busies himself straightening things up. ""I'm sorry,"" I say, ""I thought this was my apartment.""

The scene changes. On a bright clear day, at a field track whose seats are supported by white roller coaster-like scaffolds, which curve inward, like immense inverted ribs, I run laps. The golden haired woman runs close behind me. In a Dylanesque way I sing the words, ""Well, I don't mind...this whole 'Viet Naa ahm waaar.'"" To make running easier, I begin taking off my pants.

One woman, cocooned in a tangle of dark curly hair, clothes and blankets, lays motionless, dazed. The other woman stares aimlessly into space. Outside, a woman from next door runs past the street level window. I start to leave, to walk up a long ramp, past the aimless woman, to tell our neighbors what I've done"

My brother names the person. Each paper bag or cellophane sack contains a type of bread. There are fluffy rolls, white loaves, soft round pita, scraps of twisted salt pretzels. When I open that bag, the crumbs fall to the green floor, into the shed. Except for its white speckled linoleum tiles, inside the shed, which resembles the M's unfinished Ivy Street basement, it's dark, dank, forbidding.

I imagine hitting them while they're caught in broken glass. The next day, in the forest, on a dirt road, I'm trying to ride a too tall bicycle. The trick is to wheel forward, step on one pedal, then hop on. ""I'll get use to it,"" I tell myself. I pedal up a steep hill, coast down, then ride fifty yards down the straight road, back to Bob. But train tracks have replaced the road, and I imagine speeding up, trying to avoid the train behind me. I imagine being flattened, crumpled to death. I thank Bob for using the grunt photo taken in Song Be. I tell him that by placing it at the end, some people will connect the image with the other pictures of myself.

The foal changes, becomes part kangaroo, its face, especially its emotive eyes, almost human. I imagine saying, ""Talk to me. Talk."" A few bees circle around us. Then a swarm of yellow jackets, their distinctive yellow and black abdominal bands clearly visible.

In the once empty field, twenty or thirty cows stand twenty or thirty meters apart. To no one in particular I say, ""Cows everywhere."" Dressed in blue overalls, a stocky, muscular woman, the mother of the family, the boss of the farm, who resembles Lisa K, though her features are shiny and hard set, like molded plastic, begins to speak. In a dramatic voice, she describes a ferocious cow. As she continues, from behind the wood wall, a half dozen doll heads, impaled on sturdy wire, rise up, to the accompaniment of suspenseful music. The scene changes. I'm lying on a mattress with a much younger woman who resembles Lisa K. The farm family, though they wonder about our age difference, have provided this bed. In fact, there is nothing between us. As we lay beneath the warm blanket, the stars overhead, vividly, the girl recalls the man who seduced her, having seduced another woman moments before.

The fragile stairs were sagging and falling apart in pieces, and I kept crawling up and up, carrying my son. Then I was at the top, and the wind died down, and I was in a big house with more people (friends with no names), and I wondered where my father was.

As the train progressed, we passed huge piles of scrapped equipment. Large number of men would jump off the train and attempt to hide in the scrap piles, and armed guards roamed through the scrap piles and found the men almost as soon as they had hidden. I do not know where the train was going nor why I was on the train. I remember that I tried to escape from the train and hide, why, I do not know, unless it was because so many others were.

I was looking over the land to determine its possibilities for shooting (possibly hunting). I was very doubtful about my reasons for doing this or why I had chosen this plot to look over. Then I started to discuss my plans with the owner of the land who was a railroad official. I remember the plot of land as being located near the East Cleveland Station where I had sometimes played when I was a boy

There was a great crowd of people in it, but I could not distinguish any of their features. As I stood there, I saw a man in an Army uniform of the first world war. I was puzzled because I could not distinguish his rank. On one sleeve he a had a red major's star, and on the other sleeve he had a gold and black private's stripe. I was looking for someone but could not find anyone due to the large group of soldiers that were boarding the train under the direction of this one soldier described before. As I watched, a soldier came running up to the station and just managed to board the train as it pulled out of the station. The thought struck me that the soldier was a girl that used to live next door to us, but had moved many years ago. I began to chase the train yelling that the last soldier was a girl and did not belong on the train"

As I approached her and looked at her, it was not really the original girl who I thought I recognized, but another friend of mine (f, 20) who was just recently married.

As I looked at the ring, I couldn't even feel involved by sentiment. In the dream I was at that time concerned by the fact that I was not overcome by emotion nor was I angry"

It was like the tunnels that connect the various lines in the large ""metro"" (subway) stations in Paris. I came out on Euclid Ave. in front of Moe's. I walked around on Euclid and then reentered the tunnel. I returned home to find the party over and the house quiet"

As I began to pet him, he turned over on his side and his back as dogs often will do. Even while I was petting him, I felt that I couldn't trust him completely, and that he might bite me. The dog seemed to enjoy my petting and scratching him. Though I felt he might bite me, the fear of being bitten was very small, but there was a fear. I had a candy bar in my pocket, and as I rose to leave I felt that the dog wanted this candy bar (a Baby Ruth). However, I didn't want to give the dog this candy bar, and then I told him that he couldn't have it. I then left and proceeded west down Euclid Ave. on my way I believe to a typing class which I am now taking at John Hay three nights a week"

#0089",hall_male,"Herb, a friend of mine, had borrowed my car in order to transport some movie equipment. As he drove the car off, he misjudged the height of a low steel bridge; the car struck the lower part of the bridge, damaging the top of my car quite severely. Angered, I pushed my way into the car and demanded that Herb let me drive. We got underway, but the car behaved in a crazy fashion. It weaved all over the road. The brakes would not work, and there was no pick-up. Driving into the parking lot at home, I noticed several cars parked in front of my garage, so I was unable to park my car (which further irritated me). My sister then approached, glanced at the damage to my car, and began to insist loudly that our parents would not help to pay for the repairs. Angrily, I told her that I didn't expect anybody to help me with the repairs -- that I would pay for them myself"
"
#0096",hall_male,"I was on a Mayfield streetcar, going to school. It was morning, but very dark and stormy. Actually it was dark as night. I suddenly realized I had forgotten a very important book and would have to turn around and go back; I got off the streetcar at the corner of Euclid Heights and Mayfield and waited for a bus. It was raining very hard, and I was afraid that it would not come. Luckily a bus came quickly, but it went down Euclid Heights Blvd. instead of turning on Mayfield. Another bus came behind it, however, and I got on. Then I had gotten off the bus and was back again and had the book under my arm. The bus came, and I got on. I felt relieved because I would be on time"
"
#0104",hall_male,"I was seated in the living room of a girl (19) who has slept with me in the past. A friend of mine (m, 20) was there as were the girl's parents. I next found myself seated at the dinner table with the girl and another man (22) who was blackballed two semesters ago from my fraternity. I found myself cutting and heating his hand, instead of the food which was on my plate. I was impressed that he felt no pain. After dinner, we returned to the living room and then left her parents there and went to her bedroom. As we were going to bed, I noticed my friend coming into the room. I took a shot at him with a gun I found by the bedside. Suddenly this other man (the one who had been blackballed) leaped into the room and attacked me with a knife. I was terrified"
"
#0118",hall_male,"A rich ran came to me on the street and showed me a suitcase full of money. He assured me that there was a million dollars in the case. He said the money is yours if you can tear this phone book In half. If you can't I will kill your mother and father. I took him up on his wager, confident of my strength. The phone book had these rubber pages which made it stretchable but not tearable. Finally upon giving up no more strength in arms, the news came that father and mother had been murdered. I vowed I would spend the rest of my life in attempting to catch the tempting villain"
"
#0121",hall_male,"I recall taking an examination. It seems the examination is to be very long and the time allowed short. I remember talking to a girl sitting next to me in the examination and telling her that it is no use to try and answer all the questions since everyone will fail no matter how much they complete. However, I myself am trying to complete as much as I can. The room is apparently filled with other students but they are not clear and it seems that the only people I can clearly make out are the girl sitting next to me and a man instructor standing in the front of class"
"
#0122",hall_male,"I was playing volleyball. It seemed that the game was held on the lawn of a cousin's house. The other participants were unknown to me however we seemed to be talking back and forth. Then we all entered a house which apparently belonged to my cousin, however I have never seen this building before. We all sat down and indulged in various activities some listened to the radio, others danced, while still others just sat and had something to drink. I recall holding a glass of something in my hand, but I don't believe that I actually drank any of the contents. After this some of the people announced they were leaving. I decided that I should stay for the night. There were members' of both sexes present"
"
#0123",hall_male,"The dream included two girls and a boy whom I know. One of the girls was quite a close friend of mine. However, about two weeks ago I had a misunderstanding with her and the situation remains somewhat tense. In the dream this girl seems to question me about trivial things that I can't recall. Then the other girls enters but says very little. The boy enters and he also remains quite untalkative. This girl and boy then sit down and listen to the first girl question me. Finally, I take the girl by the hand, but she still continues to quiz me"
"
#0124",hall_male,"The dream took place in my own home. It seemed that a strange man was living in our home. I do not know the identity of this man, nor does he resemble anyone with whom I am acquainted. However, the strange man was apparently mixed up in some type of questionable business. Whenever I tried to question him he gave me evasive answers about himself. Finally this man said that he was going to take over our home and our family must comply with his wishes. At this point my father entered the house and drove the strange man out by force"
"
#0127",hall_male,"I was in the sitting room of a suite in which I lived 8 years ago. This was an apt. house in N.Y. I was I at the window for the purpose of telling my sister (27) who was on the opposite street (3 floors below) something which I cannot recall. However, I shook my head from side to side but my sister did not understand that I meant no to whatever matter was concerned. Whereupon I lifted the window, which was already partly open, to shout the answer and thus be understood. On the ledge (outer ledge) of the aperture were two handbags one of which (a green one) I recognizes as my sister's. In leaning out, I brushed this bag so that it started to fall to the street, but I caught it. When I had opened the window I still did not speak but shook my head as before"
"
#0128",hall_male,"I needed money and sought to regain money which someone owed me. I went to the man's house with my parents. I got the impression of luxury. The man was there with his wife. He was in his middle ages and a small man. He explained that he had a special cleansing or sterilizing bath for his guests (for his and our protection I thought). When I asked about the money he was willing to lend it to me (about $1,500) for a couple of months at 50% interest. I felt very outraged or rather unbelieving. I wanted the money to finance a play which I felt had the makings of a drama or a musical"
"
#0140",hall_male,"I don't remember where I was, except that I must have been in a rather small room. I was in an argument with one of my fraternity brothers. Somehow he fired an air rifle (I did not see him. I just knew he had fired it.) and I received a hole in my eyelid which I thought extended some distance into my head. I made quite a commotion of this to whomever was standing around. Next, I was waiting for a bus at a place where I had often waited in the past. There were two other men with me but I do not know who they were. The hole in my eyelid was still there"
"
#0141",hall_male,I was on a highway in a car and was being chased by someone. Another person of my age was with me. We figured that we could get to a certain house before the individual who was chasing us could. At this point some thought came into my head about a motor cycle but I was unable to remember what it was about. We beat this person or persons to the house. In this room there were several other people who I knew. The group was made up of boys and girls my age. We sat there with some revolvers and waited for the men to arrive. My revolver was shaped like a cigarette lighter. When the men arrived everyone gave up their guns except me. I thought that I better keep mine in case of trouble
"
#0145",hall_male,"I got up from bed to go to class. I found myself climbing up a hill with some fraternity brothers. We were looking for a place to go to eat breakfast. One guy told me we were going over to my roommate's house to eat. I said, ""Do they serve meals?"" Then I remembered that they had the best meals in town. I was in a car riding through a forest. With me there a few other guys my age. We saw a bear along side of the river which ran close to the road. I said look at the bear, It was probably washed up by the flood. Went on further, and I saw a pheasant. I said look at that pheasant and what's that behind it? It looks like a chicken hawk. The chicken hawk was sneaking up on the pheasant. As we went on I saw more pheasants. Before we got on to the main road leading to town, we stopped the car in order that some of the guys could get completely dressed. It irritated me that they didn't finish dressing before we left the house to go to eat"
"
#0151",hall_male,"My father, brother (17) and I were traveling to Toledo (actually the road was to Buffalo) in our car. We stopped at the house of an acquaintance of my father's and looked in the window. A party was going on. We went in and were invited to stay. I started to flirt with some girls of my own age (strange to me) and sat down with one of them. She got up when I started to make love to her. Another girl (wearing nothing but an open vest and a skirt) sat down with me and flirted. I caressed her breasts"
"
#0153",hall_male,I was a spy in a house in which there seemed to be a party. I didn't know why I was spying. I sat on the edge of a chair in which a man was sitting and decided to pretend to be a woman. I flirted with him and then left for the bathroom. On the way through the kitchen I saw some coffee and yelled to the man to ask him if he wanted some coffee. The house was the one in which I lived as a child. I went to the bathroom and undress. A woman knocked at the door and asked for something. I handed it to her through the door (opened a crack). The man was about 26 and a stranger. I didn't see the bathroom door but I I felt that she was in her twenties and a stranger
"
#0162",hall_male,I So to the house of a music teacher to take lessons. On the wall he has a chart (like an oculist's letter chart) with which he is going to test my musical ability since I have never taken lessons before. These charts have pictures on them. For example one shows a rocket and the question is whether I know how the rocket works. He also asks me whether I know Spanish. Later I ask him whether with the violin or the piano and he says that we'll begin on the reed instruments. I am very nosy in his house and examine all the papers on his desk
"
#0168",hall_male,"I was sitting in a drug store eating a sundae with a bunch of young people whom I don't know. I began to talk with one of the girls who was interested in going to Israel. While coming to the drug store we had passed a huge building that was in the process of being built by the most modern methods and I made an aside that I wish we could build as quickly in Israel. The girl started to talk about this when we were in the drug store, and I mentioned to her that we didn't so much need skilled engineers and contractors as we did good fast workers, bricklayers with experience, etc., and also modern equipment. She agreed with a me and said she would try to learn bricklaying"

#0171",hall_male,"A gangster is running berserk through the streets shooting everybody in sight, and getting a. great deal of pleasure out of it. Then suddenly the gangster merges into myself and I find myself running to avoid retaliation by the law. I am no longer berzerk but quite rational, and seemingly able to understand the full consequences of what I had done. I remember that one of the people I had shot with a sub machine gun was a fraternity brother of mine whom I disliked a good deal. I recalled that I had kept on shooting, but that he just wouldn't die. Finally he did. I had the feeling of relief. I did not want to be caught, so I tried to shoot myself, but that didn't work. Then I tried to take arsenic, and was conscious of a terrific pain in my side (presumably from the poison but I couldn't die. Then I began to think of how happy I had been in the last few days, and I didn't want to die. Somehow the police didn't know it was me who did the killing and I was going to bluff them out"
"
#0174",hall_male,"As the scene opens I seem to be balancing a while sitting down. After a few minutes I decided to stand up and balance it from a standing position on the edge. All of a sudden, two large boats came into the picture and I tried to go around them. Then everything turned into large boats in a sort of a maze. At first they were all friendly toward each other, and then the first two large boats became hostile over something. I tried to tell the captain of the first boatsomething helpful about the other boat, but he refused to listen. I had a feeling of disgust and anger, and turned to join sides with the other boat. I was refused here also, but another man who resembled a casual friend of mine was welcomed aboard. He laughed loudly and boarded the ship"
"
#0175",hall_male,"I was staring at a football when for some reason it turned into a sheep. It was a full size sheep with a sheep's body, but its neck was made of the lace of a football. The lace, however, had been bent, as often is the lace of a football, and the sheep's head seemed to be too heavy' for the bent lace. In the dream I loved the sheep and would continually hold it and pet it. As long as I held the sheep and loved it, the lace neck held up the head. When I stopped holding it, the head would fall down again. I had the feeling of being quite worried about the poor bent neck and a fear of letting it go because the head would fall off. I wanted very much to do something about it, and felt very bad when I couldn't"
"
#0188",hall_male,"I was on a bus going through New York City. As we approached the country a woman guide of about 30 said that we should notice something high up on a mountain. I had an aisle seat and crawled into the aisle, putting my head next to the floor in order that I might see the top of the mountain to see what the guide told us to notice. I still couldn't see the object of interest. This made me feel cheated as everyone else in the bus was exclaiming at the beautiful sight and I was the only one to miss the view"
"
#0194",hall_male,"I own a new Chevrolet. I drove it around the corner and then parked it near by a house I lived in 10 years ago. When I came back, I discovered the car was missing. I then realized I had forgotten to remove the key. After a while I went to the house I used to live in. It was a double house and I knew the people who lived downstairs. I asked her if she knew anything about the car. She didn't. As I was leaving, the lady upstairs called to me and told me the police were holding t he car and it would cost $70 to regain the car from the police"
"
#0197",hall_male,"My mother gave me some christmas cards and other articles to deliver to our neighbors. It seems that some of the cards had been delivered to our house by mistake. I started out and delivered them to the various houses, which were all familiar, but the people didn't seem to be anyone whom I knew. It was snowing out and I remember that I wasn't too happy about the weather. After delivering the last letter or package, I'm not sure which it was, I had a golf club left and no one to take it to. Therefore I began walking toward town; here an automobile pulled up beside me and I began talking to the man, who was no one I recognized, about golf and the activities of the country club. Suddenly the scene shifted and I was on the golf course watching the golfers. It was a happy feeling, no responsibility, and I seemed to be in my element. Then I went up to the club house. The club house seemed fascinating to me, just like It did when I was bout 6 years old, and I enjoyed being around it as if it were some sort of pleasure which I haven't felt for years. Then I went into the club house and my brother was playing the slot machines, which I disapprove of. However, when I entered, he had a great stroke of luck and money (nickels) was coming from every one he played. We filled our pockets and then left"

#0199",hall_male,"I was, living here in Cleveland in a fraternity house, but it was located in a downtown section. My fraternity brothers were fellows I used to know back home except one who I remember as being a fellow I know from Cleveland. I was upstairs cleaning up around. Then I came downstairs and found a lot of colored people there. Right away I noticed they had lipstick on, and this struck me as being peculiar. I couldn't help staring; once when I noticed that I was watching them, they attempted to hide their faces, some did at least. There were a bunch of dogs with them also. The dogs had fleas or something and were spreading an epidemic of disease in the neighborhood. I realized that I had to get serum to stop the epidemic. I didn't know where to get the serum. I had no transportation and went back to the fraternity house, but no one had any transportation. One fellow lent me his bicycle, so I started. I went about one block and saw a buddy of mine driving a bus, so I laid my bicycle down and asked him to take me. He said he couldn't, so I went back to get the bicycle and someone had stolen it. Finally another friend came by in a car and I got in. We started off"

#0207",hall_male,"I was in a gym, running around and jumping. Suddenly I ran into a small boy about 3 or 4 years old. My knee hit his mouth and a tooth of his was broken. He started to cry and I picked him up to soothe him. His parents came up and I paid them for the dental work that I guessed had to be done (there probably would be none, but I still gave them money). Later I found out that one of my front teeth was loosened and would have to be removed. My aunt (30) and uncle (33) came with me to a dentist and it was done"

#0215",hall_male,"I was standing in front of the school cafeteria and somehow pricked my finger. Then I was suddenly standing in front of the fireplace at the frat house. My finger was sore so I tied a string around it in order to see it more clearly. Then I saw what I thought was a very short hair right under the surface of the skin of my finger. I tried to pull it out but it began to more and went through my hand, up my arm and to my shoulder. As it began to move I saw that it had an illuminous head. this particular night it was my turn to help with the supper dishes of the frat house. I told one of the boys I would have to wash the dishes then because I had to see a doctor about the thing in my finger. We walked out into the backyard which looked like a desert. There were dishes on all sides that had to be washed but none were dirty. After a short while I got the dishes washed, borrowed a red bicycle and left for the doctor's office"
"
#0219",hall_male,"At the start of the dream I was sitting at a table with my parents eating mashed potatoes. The table was out in the street in front of our house. On each plate was a pile of potatoes about three feet high and I imagined that these potatoes were made from the insides of snakes. I then saw an automobile coming down the street and wondered how it would get past the table. The scene then changed. My car was parked in a vacant field and I had lost the keys. I spent a long time looking for the keys but never found them. I then noticed that both of the rear tires were flat. I fixed the tires, but my father ridiculed me since I didn't have any keys to operate the car. Again the scene changed. I was in Korea operating a side show. My act involved the use of two serpents. I would twist and contort one of the serpents while the other rested. I would then repeat the act with the other serpent"
"
#0221",hall_male,"I was being chased for what seemed a long time. At times I was running and other times I was in an automobile. My pursuer seemed to change from one person to another; however I could recognize none of them. The pursuer was male. Finally I entered the house where I lived and in so doing found that I was cornered. Suddenly I found my service pistol (.45 cal., automatic) in my hand. As I was running up the stairs to escape I turned to shoot my pursuer. At that time his visage became clear. He was a professor of mine from the physics department of the university. I tried to pull the trigger, but it seemed frozen. As I tried to pull it with the use of both my hands, I was about to be pounced on. At that point I awakened"
"
#0229",hall_male,"Again, this is a dream occurring just before waking in the morning as it was probably quite flexted to my will. I am in the American army and we are again at war with Germany. I am captured and imprisoned somewhere in Germany. I escape and most of the dream consists of my eluding the Germans, trying to use my one year of German effectively. Among the escapades, I resort to wounding my face with a piece of glass so as to disfigure my face making me unrecognizable. I come back to America in the uniform of a German soldier who I killed to get his clothes and paper (America is conquered). Here I act as the soldier and am able to reside at home where I try to help my family and aid the underground"

The procession was led by Dr. Millis and all the major theological leaders of town. We all wore white robes and marched down Euclid Ave. in a formation resembling a large cross. We met at Adelbert Rd. and Euclid at 4 in the morning and were to arrive at he stadium about 12 noon. We had a good time on the way telling jokes and kidding. When we reached the stadium, it was bounded by three churches, Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant. We ate the lunches that we had packed and then we listened to very interesting speeches by prominent theologians and the presidents of the colleges. Afterwards we came back in trucks and slept the rest of the afternoon. Of the speeches the best was given by a young intelligent looking priest. (I am protestant."

#0232",hall_male,"I went to my dentist's office to get my teeth checked. He looked into my mouth and drew a picture of what my teeth looked like. I looked at the picture. The teeth had brown patches on the tops of them. That is, looking down at the crown of the teeth, they were brown on top. One molar had a large cavity in it. I asked him the price of fixing the teeth and how many needed fixing. He said 12 were in need of fixing and had to be pulled out. It would cost $160. I then told my mother. The alarm rang for me to get up"

#0241",hall_male,"I was with two other friends both male and we were all coming out of Gruber's Bar when I saw a red Jaguar parked by the road. I informed my friends that I could start it so why didn't we take it. So we did but not with malice, but more as a thrill. I then became aware of the fact that there was only room for four to sit in the car. (A real Jaguar only has room for two but this had a rumble seat.) This then meant to me that if we picked up some girls there would not be enough romo in the car. The next thing I recall is that there were only two of us in the car, the driver and myself"
"
#0242",hall_male,I was washing in a bathroom at what in the dream was the Waldorf but couldn't have really been because it was much too shoddy. There was another boy in the bathroom who was also washing. (This bathroom went with our room.) Suddenly a woman materialized in the bathroom beside me. I dropped the soap in the washbowl and splashed her slightly. I apologized for my carelessness. As I was leaving I noticed that all she had on was a thin nightgown. I diverted my gaze from her because I was embarrassed at her dress and also because I had splashed her. I got into what had been my bedroom. It was filled with beds in which were young boys about 10 or 11 altogether. The dream ended
"
#0244",hall_male,"I was riding out a road in Bob's car. The road ran beside a lake and I noticed that many large turtles were immigrating from the lake to the fields on the other side of the road. There seemed to be two different types of turtles, land and sea. I asked Bob to stop the car so I could catch some of them to take home. They were very large, about a foot and a half in diameter. I caught two and put them in the trunk of the car. Then I went after some more, but when I came back to the car the two I had put in the car were dead and I was very disappointed because they seemed to be so completely dead"
"
#0261",hall_male,"I was swimming in a pool that I had frequented this summer. There were a great many girls swimming too and when I looked at them I noticed they didn't have any bathing suits on. I went underneath the water and one of the girls followed me and there was a bed on the bottom of the pool. After I had satisfied myself with one girl another came down to the bottom of the pool. This went on for a long time until I could no longer stay underneath the water. I started to dry myself after leaving the water and all the girls gathered around and blew hot air on me until I was dry. It was a wonderful sensation and I lay down on the grass and all the girls surrounded me and started to sing softly in my ears while they stroked my body with soft, gentle hands"
"
#0263",hall_male,I was walking across the street and a car hit me although I felt no pain. I was lying in the street and my legs wouldn't move. An older woman came over to me and tried to help me up. I became very frightened and didn't want her to touch me. I tried to struggle against her picking me up but I only fell down again. Another woman and then a whole flock of people came over and tried to help me. They lifted me up and started to carry me like they do a baseball player after knocking down the game winning run. I started to feel better but then I broke away from them and started to run. Nobody seemed to chase me and I slowed down to a walk but then I didn't know where I was walking to and I became afraid and it was dark all around me so I couldn't see
"
#0265",hall_male,"I was walking along a deserted street in a small town. It was about seven in the evening and starting to get dark and I thought people were staring at me from behind closed windows and doors. There was an unnatural quiet in the air and the only sound I could hear were my shoes scraping the cement. All of a sudden a shuttered window opened and a gorgeous girl, unclothed, beckoned to me. I wanted to run into the house where she was staying, but something was preventing me. My feet just couldn't move because all the people were shouting and calling me names. They told me not to go. The girl was pretty and I wanted to go with her very badly but my feet could not move"
"
#0269",hall_male,"I had taken a friend of mine to see the secret passageway in the house. We went up the stairs. I led the way. When we came to the top of the stairs, I turned to the ledge which led to the secret passage down through the house to the basement. On the ledge there were two silver blue foxes sitting in front of the entrance to the passage. They would not let us enter the passage, so we went downstairs. The friend was a cadet officer in ROTC and was in uniform. I do not know who he was as his face was indistinct"
"
#0272",hall_male,I found myself in the Adelbert Gym practicing golf. I was hitting golf ball after golf ball against the canvas curtains which divide the gym into sections. My girlfriend came into the gym. Though I was surprised to see her (for this was the boys' gym) I asked if she would like some instruction in golf. She replied that she would like to learn the game. I gave her a golf club and showed her how to swing. After she had hit nine or ten balls she said that I had better start practicing myself if I wanted to make the golf team. When I began again a boy came over to me and asked me to hit a lead golf ball. I replied that I would not for it might break the club. Then Eddie came over to me and told me to leave for the baseball players had to practice. I was very disappointed but nevertheless I picked up my clubs and left. I then awoke feeling very sad
"
#0276",hall_male,"I and a young lady of my age, along with another couple who are our age, seemed to be skiing. My date and I tested a long ski run. It seemed to be a long wooden sliding board though. We didn't have skis either. The ride down the board consisted of a slide, then one ski jump, then some more sliding, and finally before the bottom was reached there was a place which caused the slider to think that he was about to do another ski jump but instead, just as he reached the end of the take off platform he would suddenly feel that he was going to fall a huge distance and possibly get hurt or even killed. However, as he continued to go over the end he would actually safely continue a slide to the bottom of the run. All of this procedure was in a sitting position. My date and I tried out the ski run a few times and then proceeded to enjoy watching the anxiety created in the other couple by the trick spot in the run as they attempted it their first time. All four of us laughed then and then proceeded to enjoy having our stomachs come up into our mouths each time we slid down the exciting run"
"
#0279",hall_male,"I was having intercourse with my mother. She was reluctant and didn't want me to do it, but I told her that I was trying to learn something which might prove valuable to me. I was sort of curious too, as intercourse with my mother was something new and unusual. She consented although she did not become sexually aroused at all. I felt guilty and a bit disgusted during the act. We tried some postural positions which I knew that most women object to, but which I wanted to find out about. The experience was not very pleasurable in general, although I almost had an orgasm immediately before I woke up. Incidentally, no thought of my father occurred to me in this dream although earlier this same night I had a dream in which my father appeared. The dream seemed to be pleasant, but I can't remember what it was about"
"
#0283",hall_male,"I looked into a tavern and saw a neighborhood girl whom I like. I ran across the street to my car, and before entering it, I looked around to be sure she was watching. I jumped into the car and stomped on the accelerator and went roaring down the street. I said to a friend who was walking down the street, ""I must be doing a hundred."" He laughed and said, ""Oh, you're only doing fifty."" I looked at the speedometer and was surprised and rather shocked to see that he was right. I then pulled into my driveway and went into the house"
"
#0288",hall_male,This took place in the South Pacific aboard a destroyer. Somehow my mother was also aboard this ship. I was about to be transferred to an aircraft carrier. I gathered my gear together and climbed up the ladder of the aircraft carrier. Another sailor showed me to my locker. I spent quite a bit of time getting the locker open. Finally I stowed all my gear and went back on deck to return to the destroyer and say goodbye to my mother. Upon returning topside I saw that the destroyer had cast off and was moving past the carrier and I wasn't going to get to say goodbye. The dream then ended

#0295",hall_male,I was sitting at my desk waiting for class to begin when a girl I had been dating quite frequently entered the room. I was rather surprised to see her for she had been vacationing in Florida the past week. As she passed behind me to get to her seat one of her girlfriends asked her where she got the fraternity pin which was quite prominent on her blouse. She replied that she was pinned to Dinny Bernaway while in Florida. I was quite hurt to hear this for she had turned me down when I had asked her to go steady a few months earlier
"
#0303",hall_male,I was driving my car along a dark road. All of a sudden a figure lurched out in front of me. I was unable to swerve from it and I struck it head on. I was awfully afraid and I stepped on the gas to get out of there. I kept going faster and faster. Then behind me two headlights kept getting closer so I went even faster. I was going about 85 when I started to skid but I got control of the car again and thought everything was alright when an edge of a cliff was right before me. Then my car's steering went wrong and I plunged off the cliff. My dream ended here
"
#0304",hall_male,"We were walking down a path in a big forest when all of a sudden a huge bird, a hawk of some kind, came down and picked up my younger brother and carried him off to a nest. My other brother and I stood there spellbound. We ran back to our tent and got our .22 rifle which we had brought along just for target practice. We then ran to where the nest was and started to creep up on it when all of a sudden the bird took off with my younger brother. He started to fly low out over a body of water. I felt this would be the last time we would see him so I took my rifle and shot at the bird. It let go of my brother and he fell into the lake. He swam to the shore. The bird fell into the water dead. This is where my dream ended"
"
#0305",hall_male,"I was looking out the window of my bedroom. We had company downstairs and they were playing cards with my parents. I heard this motor roaring as it went by our house, and I had a funny feeling something was going to happen. It was daylight out and I could see real well what happened. This one car that was going fast started to pass another car but when he got halfway past, another car from the opposite direction plowed into it head on. It was a terrific crash with the people falling out of the cars and laying there. I ran downstairs and had my dad call the police. Then the people who were playing cards with my father and mother went to the scene of the accident to give first aid. I went too and my dream ended"
"
#0306",hall_male,I was in a room of some kind and for some reason I had to get down to the street. The only trouble was that there were men all around with guns trying to stop me. There were three men with me and one was a Cuban. At first we started down with one going first and the Cuban right behind me. The only weapon I had was a little gun that looked like a ring and it didn't shoot straight. The first guy fired at me but I just kept on running. Then I ran into a guy with a machine gun right in front of me. I went right over him shooting at him with my gun. Somehow I got through and bullied my way through the last guy and reached the stairs. Then I was awakened

#0311",hall_male,"This dream has been recurrent at the rate of twice a week since 11-10-50. Dreamer in the dream is in the US Army in combat in Europe. Subject's company has been ordered to capture a specific hill. After securing the hill further orders demand that the company secure positions in the line of advance at the base of the hill. While charging down the hill with three buddies one of the buddies hollers, ""Hit the dirt."" Everyone starts to dig in except the subject who, for some reason which he can't explain, remains erect. A shell explodes and all are safe except the subject who is killed"
"
#0314",hall_male,"In this dream the dreamer was climbing a mountain which he had been told in actual life that the particular mountain couldn't be climbed. Dreamer is actually afraid of high places, yet in the dream he is climbing a perpendicular precipice and for the first time in the climb he becomes terrified. In the dream the subject knows there is a cave immediately above him so he climbs into the cave where he rests and regains courage. The dreamer resumes his climb then his fear returns and he returns to the cave. This episode of leaving and returning to the cave recurs several times in the dream until finally the subject resolves to climb to the top. In the course of the climb said subject slips, starts to fall through space and then awakens"
"
#0323",hall_male,"In this dream my wife and I were living in a house on top of a high hill. There was a steep winding stairway descending from our house to the bottom of the hill. I would say the height of the hill was about 300 feet. I was attending some college and my mother, brother, and two friends came to visit us. They stayed for a short time, and during that time I was trying to find a baseball game on the radio, but I couldn't. It seems to me that we got into an argument over something and they decided to leave. The last thing I can remember is helping my mother down the long steep, winding stairs."
"
#0324",hall_male,In this dream my wife and I were driving along a country road when I decided to turn the car around for some unknown reason. It so happened I ran the two front wheels into a ditch. When I backed the car across the road the two front wheels came off. After getting out of the car to have a look I discovered the car was practically demolished. My brother-in-law (30) came into the picture and I asked him how much he thought it would cost to get my car fixed. The last thing I can remember is my brother-in-law telling me to junk the car
"
#0328",hall_male,"I dreamt that I was taking some kind of a test and there were other people of my age. There was a teacher or professor who was giving this test and instead of having the test written out, it was coming over a PA system and we would write the answers down. The room that we were in was big like a hall and it had tables for many more students than were there. These PA systems were put all over the hall and the voice rang through the hall. As I can remember after the test we were marched out in single file and then driven to a barracks then we were locked in. That is all I can remember"
"
#0330",hall_male,"I was in a big building in which a lot of people lived. It might have been some kind of a dormitory, but it wasn't familiar although I have been in the same room several times before. I went down a hall and turned left. At the end of the hall are suites of faculty members. The room is small with one window. There is a sewing machine in the room, a desk, a table on which there is some kind of machine with a switch on it. In the room are a number of old style goose-necked lamps. I turned on the lamps as I looked for something; can't remember what it was. I went outside with a friend and it was snowing. On a certain street at home downtown in the business district, we were driving an automobile and there were huge trucks like car carriers. Red, a little different from the real thing -- enclosed on the bottom. There were about 10 of them around. My friend was driving in and out of these trucks. I was quite tense when she hit one of the trucks. No one was hurt or even the car damaged"
"
#0331",hall_male,"For some reason I was making a phone call to find someone whose first name was Stankey. The phone rang. I ran to answer it but no one answered. As I sat there waiting I had a tremendous pain in my upper back tooth. To relieve the pain I gritted them. The more the pain the more I gritted them. As a result the tooth began to crumble. Running to the kitchen sink, I spit out piece after piece of broken tooth. (There was no sign of blood.) I returned to the phone and this Stankey was waiting quite impatiently. All the time I wished I hadn't made the call in fact from the very beginning. The result of it, if any at all, I have forgotten"
"
#0334",hall_male,"I was at a friend's house sitting in their dining room. I remember holding something like a brush and I was painting what appeared to be crackers. They kept breaking as I held the corners as I painted them. The paint was thick, almost like cheese. People kept remarking what a wonderful job I was doing. As I continued my buddy's sister let out a whoop running to the side window. It was her father returning home. I looked out too and saw him driving his car up the driveway. Someone had painted it just as I was painting the crackers. The paint also looked like cheese, very streaked and crumbling where it had dried out in places. The crackers I was working with were to be eaten for supper"

#0343",hall_male,"A group of fellows and I were on our way to a baseball game in Pittsburgh. We were walking along the street and one fellow by name of Robert Charlton was leading us. We didn't have our tickets so we stepped into this building to buy tickets out of some sort of machine. Different colors and prices determined where you would sit. I was the last one to put my money in the machine. It went out of order and I got about 20 of the best tickets free. I joined the other fellows on the street and proceeded to the ball park. The next thing I know is that we were in a large crowd. I saw several people I knew, Gilbert, male, and his sister"
"
#0344",hall_male,"It was the day of a major track meet. The coach had very little interest in my career at the time because of all his stars from previous years. They were graduating so he let me run for experience only. I won both the 440 and 880, and was he surprised. I thought I was going to die I was so sick, but I came out ok. My times were the best of the year and those 10 points of mine eventually won the meet. Thereafter the coach paid a little more attention to me. I had had the ability all along but lacked interest and wouldn't work too hard"
"
#0356",hall_male,"I was eating in a corner cafeteria when I happened to recognize one of my old schoolmates. Her name was Pat. Pat seemed to be managing the restaurant and had various employees working under her. All of a sudden I felt an ice cream cone being shoved into my hand. After I ate a little bit of the cone, I happened to drop the ice cream on the floor of the store. Pat immediately told one of her employees to pick it up for me. However, after they had picked up the cream, I refused to eat it for some unknown reason"

#0358",hall_male,"I was flying a small single-motored airplane called a piper cub with my close boyfriend, John. We were high in the skies, in fact we were above the clouds. All of a sudden the engine sputtered and I realized that we were out of gas. We lost altitude fast and as we neared the ground, one of our wings struck a high-growing tree. In a moment I realized the results of the crash. Our plane was a complete mess and furthermore John was dead. I heard another plane flying overhead and somehow began signaling with smoke signals. This strange plane began to come down but saw that we were in a narrow valley so he decided to pull out. He didn't quite make it because I heard his landing gear hit the side of the opposite mountain. I woke"

#0363",hall_male,"Was getting ready to play basketball in a big gym that looked brand new. Had a little trouble about getting my uniform but finally secured one. Remember a lot of running around on the court and in the locker room. Recall some actual playing and then leaving the arena with an old friend same age as me. We had two girls around our age, mine being a blond. My date had to get home for some reason, but we were having trouble locating the house even though she lived in it. Finally we reached a street where the names on the right hand side were set high above the street due to the terrain in that territory. We spotted the house, but my friend drove on past. Then he turned around and came back and I took her in. Fade out"
"
#0364",hall_male,"My brother and I were in Canada fishing in our motorboat. So without having any luck, we started for the cabin. I was steering when we came into an area known too well by us. The rocks up there are treacherous. We hit the rocks just submerged beneath surface and the boat went over. I kept my head and flipped the boat back over very easily even though the boat is large. It was still full of water, but still floating and we got it to the bank. The next thing I knew we were telling my dad the story. Right away he put us to work carrying lumber. I got mad when he hinted at us that we didn't have any brains. I was just carrying a piece in the cabin when I woke"

#0385",hall_male,"My baby cousin Betsie, an Army associate of mine, and I were sitting in a restaurant in the neighborhood of the WRU campus. The suggestion was made to leave and go elsewhere for a while. The place chosen was another eating place in the vicinity which had closed for the night. (It is really open all the time.) We knocked on the side door and were admitted to a view of the floor show then in progress. The attraction of the evening was a fraternity brother of mine who was introducing the next act: a group of singers who were to sing in old Scotch dialect. Involved somehow in the dream was a bet in which I lost a sum of money"
"
#0401",hall_male,"I was climbing up a mountain slope through a dense forest of evergreens. It was dark and cold and a thick mist hung low in the woods. I had the feeling that I had been climbing for hours and hours. In some way although it was not actually visible, I could see the top of the mountain, a great, white gleaming mass of ice and snow. I felt somehow that everything was against my ever reaching the top, but at the same time I had an odd feeling of confidence in the fact that nothing could stop me from reaching it. Next I found myself at timberline and looked back down over the miles of forest through which I had climbed. I suddenly felt marvelously happy and laughed and shouted, ""Fools, fools,"" at person or persons unknown below me. Then I turned again toward the summit which now seemed very near and awe-inspiring in its beauty. I woke feeling very lighthearted and was quite disappointed when I found that I had been only dreaming"

#0403",hall_male,"I appear to have been in the National Guard of Ohio. I was witnessing the trial of three of my best friends (in real life) who were convicted of some crime worthy of capital punishment. In the next scene my friends are all lined up before a large firing squad and are about to be executed. The officer in charge gives the commands, ""Ready, aim -- "" and just then I cry that some enemy has attacked Toledo and that all the guardsmen must hurry to its defense. The officer stops the execution and hurries off with his firing squad. I feel very much pleased at the clever ruse I have succeeded in and am just puzzling over a way to escape the area when I awake"
"
#0404",hall_male,"I was lying on my stomach in a high sand dune in a vast western desert. It might have been Nevada. It was evening and the sun had just gone down and it was very cool and comfortable. Far off in the distance I could see a purple range of mountains. I was very comfortable and peaceful. I remember thinking, ""I'll have to think it all out. No, there's no need for thinking any more. The whole problem is resolved. This is the final solution."" I was conscious of a gentle swelling and sinking feeling as if I were drifting in the sea. At the last minute, just before I awoke I was suddenly filled with a nameless feeling of fright and dread"
"
#0406",hall_male,"This dream was short, very vivid and made a deep impression. It took place in a very dingy and depressing room which was about 20 ft. square. The room was part of a prison. One wall was lined with bunks five high. I was in the top bunk. A door was in the wall that was perpendicular to the beds. The room was not painted and was not plastered but covered with cement and had the gloomy gray color of cement. The blankets of the bed were pulled up to my neck and were of a blackish gray. A guard (whom I didn't know and whose age I didn't notice) came into the room with a package for me. I tried to get out of the bunk to get the package. I threw the covers back but I couldn't get down to the floor"
"
#0408",hall_male,I was lying in bed. My uncle came into the room. He said something about the development of aortic arches. Then my uncle was replaced by my former piano teacher (male). He started to talk about doughnuts and tubes. Piano teacher said each doughnut weighed one pound because of these special tubes. Therefore a dozen weighed two ton. He asked me if I'd like a doughnut. Then the front wall of the bedroom was gone. Instead there was a baking shop. He got a bag of doughnuts. He showed me the doughnuts with tubes. He offered me a doughnut. I took one. He took what looked like a cupcake. It had chocolate icing. He took a chair and sat at the foot of my bed
"
#0428",hall_male,"I was seated in an old-fashioned classroom near the center front of the class. Standing to my right in the front of the class were two girls, one dressed in a red dress with white dots and white fancy lace neckpiece, the other in a green dress with white dots and fancy collar. As I sat there I was very perturbed to see that the two girls had malformed short arms -- about one-half the length of normal arms. The teacher was reprimanding me for noticing the girls' deformities and noting that they were abnormal. I awoke feeling hurt and with my ego rather shaken"
"
#0434",hall_male,"I dreamed once again that I was driving my wife's automobile which I do, not infrequently. All of a sudden the auto began to spin crazily in circles, as one spins when skidding in snow. I was overcome with anxiety for I anticipated an accident. As much as I tried I could not control the auto nor could I see where we were going. The windows were frosted and therefore a view was not to be had. After I could hear the screeching of brakes and awaited the crash but nothing happrned. At length the auto stopped spinning and I again pursued my original course"
"
#0437",hall_male,"I was seated at a card table playing poker with three other men. I was losing and felt that I should be winning. I had the impression that the game was unfair. In fact I was the only one losing. The other three men had lower cards than I did, but for some reason I was letting them take the money. They were kidding me about it and I was getting mad. On the next deal I showed everyone my cards, which were the highest on the table, but the other three men took the money and divided it among themselves. I once again showed them my cards and asked why I could not take the money. They gave no answer. I then picked up an ashtray from the table and started threatening them. In a fit of anger I threw it at a cat that suddenly appeared in the room. I hit the cat and felt relieved. The other three men excused themselves and left the room. I was looking for an answer as to how I could get my money back, but I never found one. The dream ended"
"
#0438",hall_male,"At the start of the dream I found myself in a large room filled with water. The water level reached to my hips. Suddenly I found myself wearing a pair of rubber hip boots and was overjoyed at the protection they offered. Other than the hip boots however, I was completely naked. I frantically tried to force open a door leading to another room and finally succeeded. The next room was also filled with water, but there were many hats floating on the surface. I then noticed hundreds of brown overcoats hanging on the walls above the level of the water. I wanted to get a dry one to put on, but every coat I came to was soaking wet. The same was true of every hat. After trying all the hats and coats and finding them all wet, I started to cry and that was as much of the dream as I remembered"
"
#0442",hall_male,I was standing in line in a type of cafeteria. I was with a girl who seemed to be a combination of a girl who I like very much and another who I have seen at school but do not know but I do not like her (sentiment based only on appearance). She bought something and went into the next room which seemed to be the expected procedure. After some difficulty I ordered some pie and doughnuts and paid for a check which I was to use to obtain the food from the food counter. Instead they gave me the pie there and kept the check. When I passed the doughnuts I took two of them. When the waitress asked for my check the other explained that it was ok and I went to sit down
"
#0444",hall_male,"I was with another fellow, a friend of mine. It seemed that we were in occupied territory of some foreign power. It was night and we were near a railroad which at times seemed to be a canal. We were near a crossing of two RR or canals. At the crossing there were four fellows who appeared to be of the tall blond German type. They were throwing small gas bombs at people on the trains or canal boats. The people would die and fall off. After a while my friend and I seemed to be trapped by these same four fellows and were trying to figure a way of escape. Our plan seemed to depend on the capture of some small animal and we were going to attract it with some peanut butter that we put on a crack in the window beside the corner in which we were hidden"
"
#0446",hall_male,"In this dream I had murdered a girl I have known for some time. The actual killing however did not transpire in the dream, but my conscience lead me to believe that I did the deed. The girl's body was stuffed in a cardboard box which I stayed close to with a morbid fascination or fear of being discovered. In the next scene I was racing with another automobile to the one remining space in a parking lot. I succeeded in reaching the space first and was greatly satisfied. The third and last scene returned to the body in the cardboard box. Although I was positive that I was the perpetrator it turned out that another man confessed to the murder. Upon hearing this I was relieved and my guilt feelings absolved"
"
#0447",hall_male,"The setting of this dream was in a woods on a late summer afternoon. I was walking down a path through the trees seemingly as I recollect, with some sort of problem on my mind. As I was walking along I gradually became aware of a scantily clad girl walking a short distance ahead of me. As I was looking up at her with some degree of surprise at her attire she turned around and smiled at me and began running on ahead. I started to give chase running faster and faster but never quite catching up to her. The dream ended with this little game of run and chase with an emission. The girl in this dream is not recognizable although I remember that she had blond hair which may or may not be representative of an acquaintance"
"
#0449",hall_male,"In this dream I was going to the cobbler to pick up some repaired shoes. On my return home from the shop I cut through the playground of my grade school. The next thing I knew I was inside the school building, wandering through the empty rooms. I suddenly realized that I was being followed. The situation became quite tense. Three persons appeared coming toward me. I pulled a revolver from my pocket and shot them. In the following scene I had been captured by the police and I seemed to be very much relieved over my capture -- somewhat resigned to the fate in store for me"
"
#0450",hall_male,"This dream began in the university parking lot. On my way to class I ran into a member of the faculty and I remember our exchanging remarks about his new car. Following this I found myself aboard an airliner bound for Florida. Again in this scene was the same member of the faculty and likewise we exchange some remarks which I am unable to recall. The last scene of this dream transpired on the front porch of my house. From where I was sitting I saw a large airplane fly over my house and as it was flying along it fired several blasts releasing a cloud of black smoke each time. The plane landed on the street and as it landed it became a much smaller craft. A woman (age 30) a friend, got out. I asked her to take me up for a ride, but she refused because she had just paid $3000 for a new carburator. Dream ended at this point"
"
#0461",hall_male,"I walked into a bar and had a drink with a friend I had just met. He was in the service with me and I actually hadn't seen him for a year or more. But in the dream I met him as I would if I had seen him every day. When I was talking to my friend another fellow walked up and my friend introduced me saying this third man was a friend of his. Number 3 invited us in the back room for a drink. When number 3 opened the door I saw the room was full of men, who were quite hard to see through the dim light and smoke. They immediately began to advance and my friend and I, backed against a wall, and began knocking them down. Number 3 also turned on us. I couldn't seem to be harmed but I knocked man after man down as they would approach. It ended here"
"
#0462",hall_male,"As the dream began I found myself walking down a street that resembled that of Wall Street in New York City. My clothes were torn and shabby and I resembled a typical bum. I was asking the men (very wealthy looking) for a handout when they walked out the door of this one building which I was standing in front of. When finally one man came out who resembled my father and threw me a coin which I missed, it rolled down the sidewalk and into a little stairway that led to the basement of one of the buildings. When I walked down the steps where the coin had rolled I saw the entire stairway was filled with coins and bills of all denominations. I then leaped into the huge pile of money at the foot of the stairs and began to let the coins and bills run through my hands. I seemed to enjoy the feeling of having the money cover my entire body. I then began to stack the bills and coins very neatly in one corner when my dream ended"
"
#0467",hall_male,"I dreamt that I was out for a ride in my car. My girl and her sister were along. Betty's sister, Gladys, has a driver's license so I let her drive the car for a while. I remember that we got off the main road and were driving up and down hills on a side road. Gladys is a good driver and she wasn't breaking any laws. I remember this very distinctly. However, as we were going down one of the hills we were stopped by a police car. As we stopped I asked Gladys if she had her license with her. She said no and became rather angry. Instead of the cop coming up to me in the car, he just sat there in his and I had to go back to him. He wouldn't tell me what we had done wrong, but gave me a ticket anyway. The police car was a very odd affair, being gray, very long. As a matter of fact, it was more like a bus than a police car. After the police had driven off I began to think the situation over and it burned me up. I was about to go to the police station and demand an explanation when the dream ended"

#0471",hall_male,"My twin brother Seymour and I were among a large number of soldiers arriving at an Army airfield in Japan. Several other GIs were boarding planes for return to the United States. Both of us were very happy to learn that we were returning home tomorrow by air. Our group was divided into units of six men each. I was number 11; my brother number 12. The first unit left at 12 o'clock. Our group was to take off at 2 o'clock. Before leaving I told number 13 that he was unlucky as his unit wouldn't leave till the following day. Then my brother and I were in a small plane the pilot of which was Capt. Arnold (m, 26, an officer in our unit while I was in service). Though our group was supposed to be composed of six men; only my brother and I and the pilot were in the airplane. The three of us were in the pilot's cabin when Capt. Arnold went to the rear of the plane instructing me to take over the controls. That was the end of the dream"

#0472",hall_male,"My twin brother, my friend Mort, and I were going to the fraternity barn dance. I was driving as we were to call for the girls at 8:30. After picking up my date, we waited for a phone call from Mort. By 11:30 he had not called as my date, my brother and I drove out to the dance. Mort and his date were already there. We then drove back on a road with streetcar tracks. I left my brother at his date's house and went to my house to change clothes (for some unknown reason). While at my house, my date (age 19) and I were alone. We were waiting for my brother to call. I thought to myself that this was an opportune moment to make love to my date. Just then however, my mother and dad reutnred and I was trying to explain to them why my date and I were alone in our house"
"
#0473",hall_male,"I was playing catch with Al (my frat brother) on a paved highway. Suddenly a jeep pulled up behind me and an army captain was bawling me out for not saluting him. (I had suddenly become a sergeant.) The captain was in his twenties, but I do not recall his face. He was short and heavy set. He further chewed me out for not having my shirt buttoned. He told me I would have to pull extra guard duty for a week. The extra duty would only be from 7:30 to 8:30. Then I was strolling down Abington, towards a Mather class, and I (once again a civilian) remarked to myself that this was only a dream"
"
#0479",hall_male,In this dream I dreamt that I was walking along a path that was in a suburb and there was a river in the valley. I thought to myself I wish I had a fishing pole and I could go fishing. The scene shifted and I was wading along the river fishing with a flyrod. The river was very dirty and shallow where I was fishing and the bottom was very muddy and sticky. I saw how dirty the water was and decided that I would walk up the river and try to find deeper and cleaner water where I could fish. I walked along the river bank until I saw faster and clearer water. I reentered the river and began to fish again. I had no luck and was about to go further up river when I saw two fishermen coming down the river. They came up to me and I saw they were two friends of mine about 28 years old with whom I frequently go fishing. I asked them whether they had caught any fish and they answered yes. I asked them if they would give me some bait and they said it was all gone. It then began to rain and we began to run back to town. The path was very straight and lined with trees. We hardly got wet. It was lightning very hard when we got into town. A man drove past in a blue Chevrolet coupe and yelled
"
#0480",hall_male,I dreamt that I was walking along a street when I suddenly realized I was in the army. I could hardly believe it when I realized that I was in the service. It did not seem to agitate me very much except that it surprised me. I thought to myself that since I was taken from college I should be an officer. I looked at my uniform and saw that it was a second lieutenant's suit. I became very pleased and began to whisper to a passerby that I was a bigshot. The passerby seemed to be shadowy and vague. I began to get hungry and I thought I would go up and eat with the general. I walked a little ways until I came to a white building and I went in. There was a fat man about 50 sitting in a chair (the general) and a sergeant about 30 was cooking breakfast. The sergeant looked just like a bartender that I know in my hometown. When I told them this they began to laugh
"
#0481",hall_male,I was upstairs in our house in my room. My cousin was with me. She was going to go downstairs. I didn't want her to go so I took hold of her wrist. She couldn't get away so she took a syringe and needle from her handbag and went about giving me an injection of some drug that would make me loosen my grasp. She is a nurse and knows about such things. After she gave me that shot I got weak and let go. I stood up and it seemed that I fell back on the bed after having passed out for a minute. Then I awoke
"
#0485",hall_male,"I dreamed that two people I didn't know and myself went to a house of a prostitute. I knocked on the door and a man came. He turned us away, but I knocked again and he let us in. I went to a room and found a girl naked and washing her genital organs. I could smell a sweet perfume. I took my clothes off and she got on the bed and spread her legs apart. My penis was erect and I put it into her vagina, but I couldn't get it all the way in. I took hold of her organs and pulled them a little to get my organ in. I did not have an emission. Some people came and I tried to hide my head"

#0488",hall_male,"I have a date with a girl. She is the ticket taker at a movie house and I have admired her frequently (in reality). Now we are at a picnic place by the sea. She feels a bit out of place. We are in a Jewish crowd and she is the only Christian girl there. Besides everyone thinks she is a whore which I am both suspicious and hopeful of. I notice that she is ill at ease and we walk away and go to a platform from which we watch the sea. I have clasped her hand and I am overcome with tenderness for her. (I think she is wearing her usher's uniform. During the dream I noticed that she was flat-breasted.) We admire with poetic sensitivity, the sea. I ask her whether I might kiss her. She said she did not mind but told me she was incapable of passion. I did not mind too much"
"
#0490",hall_male,"I dreamed that it was early in the morning just before my father left for work. I was sitting at the breakfast table half-sleeping and he yelled at me for being out so late the last night. I yelled back. From there we talked about school and he said he objected to my taking such useless courses as philosophy. I got very angry and screamed back at him, asserting my rights. My mother told me fearfully that I should not excite him, but I did not care. He had already gotten a pressure on his heart and had to take a pill for it"
"
#0491",hall_male,"I dreamt that I met a girl that I had known about seven years ago when I was in high school. I happened to be iwth a friend of mine who is of recent times and had no association with the girl at any time. The three of us drove all over and I never seemed to get anywhere, but we were always driving. I remember it was raining and the three of us would stop and walk a while. The three of us all were on the approximate same age. I remember the girl was rather scantily clad. The main determining thing about the dream was that the girl was far more attractive in the dream than in real life, particularly her legs. We seemed to be getting nowhere. The dream more or less fizzled without anything happening but us walking and driving in the rain"
"
#0494",hall_male,"I dreamt that I was in some Oriental country and that I was going to an Indian church. I had seemingly been to the church before and was rather scared as I had caused a disturbance and been beaten up. There were quite a few other church groups, but I chose this one. I was sure that I would get into trouble, but a friend of mine went along. He got along quite famously with the leader but I seemed to have trouble. There was quite a bit of feeling towards me. I finally left. I thought I would be in trouble, but my friend pacified the crowd. We went on our way"
"
#0004",hall_female,"I was riding a bicycle with a boy who is a student here at school and we were going to the movies. The surroundings were unfamiliar and we both suddenly realized there would be no place to put the bikes, so we returned. On the way back, however, he had to cross a bridge and when we got to the middle of it, it opened like a draw bridge, only too fast for us to get off. We both fell into the water, which seemed to be a canal. The water was very clear ad green like in a swimming pool and it took a lot of effort getting to the surface"
"
#0006",hall_female,"I dreamed that Norma (18), a girl who resides in the same dormitory as I, and I decided to change rooms. I was going to take the room I had last year and she was going to take my present room. I packed some of my things in a suitcase and went down to my old room. However, the present occupant of the room hadn't removed her things from the room. Since I had no place to put my things, I took my suitcase and went back to my present room. There I saw Norma had already moved in. She had changed some of the furniture around and was standing by the window ironing. I told her I couldn't get back my old room and she only laughed. I started to take her clothes out of the drawer and to put them in her suitcase. She had a lot of money lying on top of the dresser, which I also removed and put in the suitcase"
"
#0009",hall_female,"I dreamed I was sitting in my room at my desk. The room did not look like mine, but rather like Doris' (18, a girl who lives in the room next to mine) room. As I was sitting at my desk looking out the window, I noticed a pen on my desk which was situated in a dish of ink. I knew that a man was in my room and I immediately ran out of the room. I asked one of the girls (I can't remember what she looked like) to come to my room and see if anyone was in the closet. We both entered the room, whereupon she opened the closet door and shut it again. Then she said I saw a man in the closet. As we fled from the room, the closet door opened and an old man darted out. We ran down the stairs, closely followed by the old man. Suddenly the other girl stopped and extended her foot. The old man stumbled over it and fell down the stairs"
"
#0030",hall_female,"My kid sister (15) and I were getting ready for bed in the room next to ours. I went into our room to get my pajamas and I noticed that the window shades were up. Our double room looked out on the porch roof and as I walked to the window, I had the feeling that someone was on the roof. I pulled the blind down, but a hand reached in the window and pushed it back up. A man was out on the roof grinning at me. I was angry and tried to call my father, but I couldn't. I went into his room and woke him up. I told him very incoherently what happened and he got up. I didn't want him to go in our room because he might get hurt, but he insisted. As he walked down the hall, I forced myself to wake up. I was afraid to go back to sleep because I didn't want to know what might come next"
"
#0032",hall_female,"Last night I dreamt that I received a phone call at the dorm and it was my father telling me that I shouldn't get excited, but my mother was killed. It seems she and my father were fishing on the lake, which they never do, and some sort of electric current from the motor electrocuted her. My father and little sister didn't seem to be terribly upset about the whole thing and I just couldn't understand it because I was crying and crying and kept calling home to find out if it were really so. I can remember walking in a cemetery which seemed like Forest Lawn Cemetery in Los Angeles and again I was crying. That's about all I remember except that I kept seeing my mother's face in front of me. I woke up in the middle of the night and felt as though I had been crying all night and I felt very upset"
"
#0039",hall_female,"I was joining a sorority. I saw a large room in which we met. The name of the sorority was Phi Beta. It was a high school group. I don't know why I picked on that sorority to dream about since I never went around with these girls in high school. I had something very important to say, but I wasn't called. I got very angry and left the room. Later I asked someone why I wasn't called on. They said it was because I was Jewish. The group of girls in the sorority were all Jewish. When I left the room, I went to the lavatories. When I returned, a dance was going on. I saw some boys I had dated - can't remember names"
"
#0042",hall_female,"I dreamt that a friend of mine who graduated last year came back to the dorm for Stunt Night. I was really happy to see her. Another friend took care of her and gave her my bed to sleep in. Meanwhile another girl whom I'm not too friendly with was engaged to a boy whom she was not very much in love with. He was very wealthy and her ring was so beautiful that she didn't want to wear it around school. She was always putting her arms around me and on me, a very affectionate girl. I dreamed that I had to go to the john. Later I went downstairs and my friend who took care of the visitor and I proceeded to tell her about our affairs at school and our respective boyfriends"
"
#0046",hall_female,"I was the only person in the dream that I recognized. I was walking past an old brick building behind our house and for some reason I turned to look back at the building. The lower left part of the wall was gone and a room that had not existed was left bare. In a straight chair was seated a naked man, his left side facing me. A naked woman was bending over him; they were in the act of intercourse. Just the two figures were visible to me and the beauty of the pose and the symphony of body movements struck me speechless. Then suddenly the figures were gone and what appeared to be the neighborhood children filed out of the room looking furtively from side to side. I was again struck, but this time by a feeling of abhorrence at the thought of children picking up sex in a manner they know is wrong"
"
#0047",hall_female,"I was in a car with a date unknown to me, but I have a strong feeling it was my fiance. (I'm not sure as I do not want it to be him.) We were driving along, not speaking. I was cold and uninterested in my surroundings and company. I saw a huge obstacle loom in front of us but was not moved? (C.S.H.) to warn my companion who was driving and who did not see it. There was a crash and he was struck down dead. I merely brushed his body aside and slipped under the driver's wheel and started on, oblivious of the limp body beside me"
"
#0049",hall_female,"I dreamed that my roommate (20) who would never consciously do anything ethically wrong, had just come in from a date with a fellow (21) with whom she had almost been pinned to a year before. She was completely happy and content, not withstanding the fact that she had just slept with him and she was now pregnant. The fellow came into the dream pictured as a martyr who will make an honest woman of her, so he gave her a set of rings that were nothing but stone or glass - big and glaring. He had no recollection of ever having intercourse with her, although he admitted that they had fallen asleep in bed. My roommate was happy that at least she had him to herself. I was surprised at her reaction and wondered how she could ever feel that he could really love her, but she was unconcerned"
"
#0051",hall_female,"I dreamed that I and my family were Puritans. We were living the same house as we live in today, however. I was shelling peas, and was in an old-fashioned dress when a girlfriend of mine, Charlotte Kominsky (20) came over. She asked to borrow something (I can't remember what) and mother said, ""Bridget (which was my name), go up in the attic and get it for her."" I went up to my room with a stepladder for there are no steps leading up to our attic, and climbed up on it, pulled back and door, and a bird flew out and got caught between my hair and my neck"
"
#0061",hall_female,"I dreamed that a man continually would come to my dormitory, ring the doorbell and while he waited at the door, I would hide in the living room behind a chair until I would see him leave. I seemed to be aware of the fact that I was terribly afraid of him, although I had never seen him before and he didn't look like anyone I had ever seen or known. I believe that a story had been going around the dorm (in the dream) that man would come around to all the dorms and attack the girls. I woke up after the dream (6:30) and was very much afraid. My heart was beating very quickly"
"
#0063",hall_female,"I dreamed that Dean Dolan was explaining the construction of some English sentences to me. I had them all correct except one which she switched around to make it the right construction. Then we walked out of the classroom since she a class and so did I. As we came out into the hall, I saw a friend of mine coming out of another classroom. He looked as though he just had a biology class of some sort because he had a white coat and a pair of white trousers on. He had a bandage on his hand and half way up his arm. I asked him what had happened and he said he was playing football and had broken his wrist. I waited until he put his coat on and then we went home together"
"
#0066",hall_female,"Two friends, Nancy (19) my ex-roommate and Julia, girl living across the hall in my dorm and I were in a bathroom chatting. Nancy replied to my statement with a rather sarcastic hum which in real life torments me to some extent. I got so excited that I took her head in my hands and banged it twice against the wall. She was resisting strenuously. As I was about to do it the third time, I controlled myself and stopped. I think Nancy was laughing while she tried resisting just as if my actions were amusing with no intent to injure. I don't know whether my feelings were of wanting to hurt her or just to pretend I was disturbed"
"
#0069",hall_female,"In my dream I was in bed aware of the fact that I was about to give birth to a baby. I fell into a deep sleep or when I woke the baby had been born. I had no pain and there was no evidence of afterbirth. At the time my parents were away and on returning both were overjoyed, especially my father (this is odd because actually my father hides his true feelings very well). I gave birth to a beautiful girl with long hair. She was very tiny, but very active. The happiness and love for my child and the baby's beauty was predominant in the dream. Then somehow my relations and I were together. I can't recall how we were united why or when. My uncle was predominant. He gave the baby some sort of a cradle or bassinet. This baby always attempted to get out of it. Everyone seemed surprised at my having a baby and I kept telling everyone I was married to Bob (Bob is the person with whom I have just broken up and whom I had planned to marry) although I had no ring. Then I remember a car but that's all. I didn't recall its significance"
"
#0072",hall_female,"I was just about to enter my sociology class when I saw a few girls (unknown to me) seated at a table across the hall. I, too, sat down there. Then my instructor came and began talking to the girls. I thought that if I kept silent, he wouldn't notice I didn't belong and my presence would do no harm. He then passed out papers for the girls to sign. Since I was no part of the project or whatever it was, I decided it was time to leave. I didn't want to sign something and later get into trouble."
"
#0075",hall_female,All I remember of this dream is that my brother (16) re-entered a room I was in. He began upsetting everything in the room and doing everything he could to dirty it up--emptying the earth from flower pots was one specific way I remember. He was doing all this to spite me because I pleaded with him not to dirty the room. He also knows that I like to keep a clean room clean. Then I went seeking persons to help and I remember begging someone to convince my brother to stop but the person said he couldn't help me. This person was a nonentity. I don't even remember seeing a face
"
#0076",hall_female,"I dreamed of 2 girls (I know them personally and always think of them together) both dressed exactly alike. They were beautiful silver-white fur coats which I liked very much. Both were very dressed up, and I remember especially that they wore light blue dresses. We were at a lakeshore. Some older person (a woman) of authority was there. She may have been a teacher. Other young people were there too, but I can't remember who they were. We went out upon the water and went fishing, being quite successful and catching quite a few. I remember that I couldn't understand why the two girls were dressed up for such an occasion. I remember that the weather was fine that day--a blue sky and a bright sun, but it was a little cold"
"
#0089",hall_female,"A friend of mine (m, 23) took me into a building in search of something (I don't know what). He opened a door and there was a winding corridor cluttered with dusty antiques. We followed the passageway until we came to an open room. Several men popped up from behind objects with rifles, and we were stopped. Then two girls (probably about 25) came in with the leader (m) of the gang who was fat and about 35-40. My friend was taken away and I was led into a waiting room where I sat with the two girls and a man. Eventually another girl came out of the room adjoining the waiting room and said it was my turn to go into the leader's bedroom. The scene changed to the hallway where we had originally entered. There was my friend and several policemen (I was just an onlooker for this portion) and they were in the process of collecting the gang together"
"
#0095",hall_female,"I dreamed I had to go on a long ocean voyage and I was in uniform of some branch of the military forces. Seats were assigned and I found my seat was on a small platform on the lower part of the vessel almost at water level. The platform was only protected from the elements by an iron railing, and the waves kept flooding the floor. When I asked why I was assigned to this seat, the ship's officer replied that I was classified a ""masculine personnel"" and must keep that seat during the whole voyage. The next thing I remember is talking to some other people seated at the same place and regretting I'd forgotten my knitting. Then all of a sudden I was in a dance hall, still on the ship, and dancing with many different fellows who kept cutting in on each other"
"
#0096",hall_female,"This dream concerns an artist friend of my husband's. He is an old friend and he and my husband have known each other since they were children. He is about 25. The dream itself is short. Only a fragment. In my dreams, I saw this friend of a fellow art student who was painting a picture. I felt rather puzzled at seeing him at art school and back in Cleveland, as I knew that he had graduated from art school this September and had received a position as a commercial artist in Chicago to where he moved with his wife just several weeks ago. When I asked him why he was here, he said that he disliked Chicago and his job and preferred going to school. For that reason he came back. I felt happy about the fact that he returned"
"
#0107",hall_female,"I dreamed that the parents of a boy I have known for over a year came to our house for dinner. I have never met his parents, but I have heard much about them. We were having a buffet dinner and eating on a card table placed at the foot (sidewalk end) of the driveway. The card table kept collapsing. Finally I saw another card table top in the driveway, so I tore the present top off the wobbling legs and put the other top on. Then I noticed a deep pit where the top had been lying. I went to look for some boards to cover the hole with, and when I found some and went back to the driveway, the hole was gone. I don't know what happened to the parents"
"
#0120",hall_female,"I was working in a jewelry store. A man whom I knew in his early thirties came in to buy his small daughter, 5, a present. They looked at several of the rings, including rubies and emeralds, but the little girl was particularly pleased with small carved animals in pastel colors. When he left the store I realized that he was leaving town and I hadn't said goodbye. I ran after him in pink socks and no shoes, although it was raining. I got to the station only to discover that the train had pulled out. However, another train had just come in. My father got off it and I was very pleased to see him"
"
#0125",hall_female,"I was going to a baseball game at the stadium. I was to meet a friend there at 3 o'clock but the game started at 2. I kept thinking that I should get ready to go to the game, but I never quite got dressed. I then found myself at a dinner at Stouffer's Restaurant at Shaker Square. At this dinner were several of my classmates from Mather. I remember seeing an elderly woman there who was in my Spanish class. We conversed in several minutes and then I heard my mother asking me what the score of the Ohio State game was. I couldn't remember the score, but I said someone made along run. The conversation then turned to the subject of a fraternity at Shaw High School called Phacoms. We talked about how may of them were married"
"
#0126",hall_female,"I had a dream where I was riding in a beautiful car on a highway over the Pacific Ocean. The beautiful scenery and the ocean I can recall. I remember how relaxed I was taking this trip and how much I was enjoying it. We got off by the ocean and stood on the cliff and watched the waves come up as we felt the clean air and the beauty of nature. We traveled around visiting different places and enjoying the various sights. The participants of this dream were my boyfriend, 23, and I. The colors remembered are blue and green"
"
#0130",hall_female,"I was playing ping pong at a church I remembered as being way out in Sacramento, California. The setting was so realistic, it was like I was there yesterday. As we were playing (my opponent I cannot place) a man suddenly came in and asked for some money. He looked like a beggar or a tramp. I found a nickel in my purse and gave it to him. Apparently this was not what he had come for. He started to come toward us and while screaming, we ran out the back way and up the stairs where I used to live. He followed and I called to my mother who came out and the tramp just ran as fast as he could. I woke up so suddenly terrified by this dream. The participants other than myself were this man about 50, a complete stranger, the girl I was playing with I cannot recall"
"
#0142",hall_female,"In this dream as in many I was at my home in West Va. I was in the yard playing with one or two unidentifiable persons, when suddenly by the porch steps I saw a snake and it was a very brilliant shade of gold. In extreme fear, we ran into the house and slammed the door, breaking an orange and pink-colored vase. Later I looked out of the front window, the snake was still there and our yard had turned into an ice skating pond for in the distant part of it two persons were skating, unaware of the imminent danger which the snake represented. However, I awakened at this point before any harm had been committed by the ominous creature"
"
#0155",hall_female,"I went into the reserve bookstore to buy some green-lined three-ring notebook paper. There were quite a few people in the store. I do not remember seeing any faces clearly. I saw a stack of the paper I wanted , but the pile was uneven and each package had about five sheets in it and were all dirty and messed up. I think someone looked at me quizzically while I looked through them to find a neat, clean package. So I turned around and found a nice neat stack of the paper I had come to buy and picked up a package"
"
#0158",hall_female,"I was living in an apartment hotel and was attending a party in another suite in the building. When I left the party I was going to go straight down to the main floor in the elevator, but thought better of it and got off at my floor. When I opened the door of my suite, the maid and butler were just pulling a large bag full of stolen things through the hall to take it out the door. The maid rain away immediately but the butler remained to express his regrets that their scheme hadn't worked. I for one was happy it hadn't"
"
#0159",hall_female,"Our family doctor (a good friend of ours), his wife, and another man were visiting my mother and myself in our home. The man left and we heard a shot. We ran to the window and someone was shooting him in the back. Our doctor went out to help him and he was shot four times in the base of the spine. An ambulance came and took both men away. In about an hour the man was back, not much worse for the wear. The doctor was getting along alright, but he would be in the hospital for a while. Some sort of impairment was expected from his injury"
"
#0161",hall_female,"I was part of a nationality parade in downtown Cleveland. We were marching three abreast. Each national group was distinct by something they wore. One group I remember wore Philadelphia cream cheese packages in their ears. The Russian group wore on their lapels red and white flowers. I glanced at the person marching next to me (a young woman, I think). She had little black dots resembling raisins in her ears. That meant she was a Sicilian, which made me one too because I was marching with her. The sky began to get dark and it began to rain. I had to leave the parade and round up my nursery school group. I could only find 3 of them. Two were 3-1/2 year old boys and the third was the nursery director's girl, who's also in my group. I looked for the children's drivers to take them home. I was carrying one of the boys who, though in real life is quite large, felt very light. We finally met one of the drivers who took the little girl. It was very dark and raining hard by now. Since I couldn't find the 2 boys' driver, I began to look for my car, which had been parked somewhere downtown. I couldn't find that either. Finally met the nursery director. She didn't seem at all worried where her little girl was, nor cared where my car was. She got into her car and drove away"
"
#0169",hall_female,"I was skating on the outdoor ice pond that used to be across the street from my house. I was not alone, but I did not recognize any of the other people who were skating around. I went through my whole repertoire of jumps, spires, and steps-some of which I can do and some of which I'm not yet sure of. They were all executed flawlessly-some I repeated, some I did only once. I seemed to know that if I went into competition, I would be sure of coming in third because there were only three contestants. Up to that time I hadn't considered it because I hadn't thought I was good enough, but now since everything was going so well, I decided to enter"
"
#0176",hall_female,"I dreamed that I was driving along the street and the traffic was very heavy. There was a woman who was swinging from one lane of traffic into another. My roommate was with me. She is a school teacher, 23, I commented to her about this stupid driver, alongside of us at the present time. Although the windows of my car were closed, the woman heard me and looked at me as though she was quite insulted. After she had looked at me in this manner, she turned her car directly toward me and drove right into my car. The woman driving the other car seemed to be about 40 years old"
"
#0179",hall_female,"I was in our cellar at home with a former instructor. We were debating about what would be the best procedure to go about getting a stuffed water drain cleaned. I was sitting on the washing machine in my nurse's uniform smoking, and she was on her hands and knees inspecting the drain. After a few minutes my father walked into the room and I introduced him to my former instructor. He was very rude when she asked him if he would get the drain cleaned. I stood next to her and whispered to my father that he should be nicer. The instructor in this dream appeared actually as she is, and she is about 35 years of age"
"
#0188",hall_female,"I dreamt I was in an 8 o'clock class with a girl who eats in our dining room, but is not in any of my classes. When I walked in, she was sitting there looking very tired. Her face was chapped, her eyes were red, and her hair was very straight and stringy. A very old lady whom I can't place, but seemed to know, had at the time come in and placed her hand on this girl's shoulder. How are you feeling, Pat? she asked. Pat replied that she was very tired. The lady asked her if it was a boy or a girl. She said it's a baby girl, but I just couldn't see missing my 8 o'clock class"
"
#0190",hall_female,"I dreamed that I was a small child, staying at the home of an aged lady. She kept insisting that I go upstairs to see her beautiful daughter, which I finally did. I opened the door and she was lying on the bed--dead. I did not walk over to her, I just knew she was dead. I came back downstairs and couldn't bring myself to tell the old lady that she was dead. I knew we were having company and I was worried that they would come soon. A large group of people walked through the front door and upstairs without knocking. I knew they would find the dead girl. I stood down at the foot of the stairs and heard much talking upstairs. I ran out of the front door and down the street"
"
#0195",hall_female,"I was to leave for California the next afternoon early. School was still in session and I planned to attend the classes all day, but soon realized that it would be impossible. I found it hard to convince myself that it wouldn't make any difference. I was not packed, and mother was to help by getting breakfast for me, but she didn't, and I couldn't find any clothes to take. Finally I packed my winter bathrobe and that's about all. I was to fly, a fact which has been a source of fear in other dreams, but was not too important except that I remember saying, ""Everything here is finished anyway. I've started nothing new."" My sister and a girlfriend were going too, but the arrangements were vague. I was to fly alone"
"
#0199",hall_female,"I had just returned from a vacation or somewhere to my classes at Cleveland Heights High. I was taking over my first gym class as a student leader or gym cadet as they are called. I did not know any of the other cadets because I had been gone so long. They were all strangers and regarded me with great curiosity because I was so much older than they. I did not know the gym teacher either and they seemed unwilling to allow me to conduct a class. When they finally consented, I had great difficulty in leading the girls because they did not respect my authority. I left the class as soon as I could and went to the dressing room feeling very depressed"
"
#0206",hall_female,"For a little while I was walking up a sidewalk on a road that needed mending. I remember climbing over piles of dirt and rocks. Then I was riding in a car with two boys, Leonard and John, with me in between. We were riding up a street lined by 2-story buildings. The outside wall of all the top stories was colored a brilliant deep sky blue. The sun was shining. The sky turned exactly the same deep shade of blue as the buildings so that there was blue, blue, blue all over. It was so bright and lovely that I almost cried. Next I was in a new, modern apartment on the first floor up on a hill. It had big light window sand pink decorations. When I walked in, I said, ""This needs just a touch of blue."" Then I looked around and saw at some of the little windows, flower vases, pillows, were blue. Outside was a porch, and below was a big tennis court for all the kids to play on. My brother was down there. At the time it was getting dark at twilight and I could see tiny lights in the distance"
"
#0209",hall_female,"There was much more to the dream than this, but I can't remember it. I dreamed that I was supposed to go out with a boy on Saturday. I'm not sure which boy it was, but it was one of two that I date now. Then another boy named Victor asked me out for Saturday. (Victor is the first boy I ever went with. We broke up several years ago, but there has been attraction on both our parts ever since. I still like him, but he goes out with a good friend of mine. Since we understand each other, he periodically comes and tells me all his troubles.) When in the dream he asked me out, I knew that I already had a date, but I said okay, I would see him Saturday. He grinned, looking as if he knew about my other date, and left"
"
#0213",hall_female,"I dreamt that I was crossing the street toward 107th Street by the Elysium Auto Sales when I heard some people in a car plotting a murder. Somehow I seemed to keep going back and forth across the street without seeming to be detected, and thus hearing the whole plot. A man who was a gangster was going to murder his mother-in-law. The only motive for this crime seemed to be that she had bought a hat that was too small for her. This gangster later found out that I heard the plot and was going to try to catch me. There was a man at the Elysium Auto Sales who was going to help me from being caught, however. The murderer's gang had come to the building where I was in a car. When I got in the car, it seemed to be enclosed; there was another car in front of it and the wall of the building in the back. When I did try to go, I seemed to go backwards. As the car seemed to start its slow backward motion, the dream ended"

#0227",hall_female,"I dreamt that I was in a large auditorium where a large crowd was seated. Many of the women carried hand-made white cardboard lambs. We were waiting for a famous movie actor to make his appearance. A man came on the stage, and said there was an accident. A girl who danced had to be substituted for the injured actor. My mother and I had to leave early because I had to go to the dentist. When we arrived, we found that the building was being torn down. The dentist was dressed in dirty overalls, but he put on a white doctor's gown over the overalls and began to work on my teeth"

#0229",hall_female,"I dreamt that I was invited to a large party held by a group of sororities. The one sorority that I seemed to be most interested in had chartered a bus. Several of the girls had dates. I did not, but the boy with whom I had gone to the stunt night dance was sitting in the seat behind me holding hands with a woman almost twice his age, and presently we turned around and began talking to the boy with whom I had gone and the woman. We talked of generalities, such as the weather, etc. Finally the ride seemed to be over for everyone left the bus. All the while, however, I was not conscious that the bus had been moving. We went into a large building in which each sorority had its own particular room. To get to the room of the sorority I was with, we had to go through the room of another sorority which I disliked intensely. But the room was empty and we went through into our own room"

#0232",hall_female,"My sister (16) and I seemed to be down by the lake and going to go in swimming. The water was beautiful and quite shallow in some spots, shallow enough that you could see green grass growing up from the bottom and out through the water. I felt that I needed exercise badly and I really wanted to go swimming on account of this. It seems that Miss Andreas of the gym department and some other gym faculty were there, but I don't remember them too clearly. Well, I was quite fearful of the snakes and other water creatures that might be hovering around in the shallow water, but I went in anyway and was very glad I did because the water felt nice. I woke up then"
"
#0238",hall_female,"I was in my bedroom and the window opened and a baseball player came in. He smiled and said he was looking for something. I asked him who he was and his answer was ""a Cleveland Indian"" and I was impressed. Then a crowd of the dorm kids came in and I told them, and they smiled and said he wasn't. He carried an aluminum rod which I supposed to be a bat. Then he leaped out of the window onto a tremendous ball field and suddenly there were hundreds and hundreds of people and they were all stampeding somewhere, while many others were playing baseball. I laughed because suddenly I saw that the Cleveland Indian wasn't one at all and he laughed too. I don't know why. He was medium height with black hair and very brown eyes. I know I'd seen him before. The people were running, very happily--it was some sort of a game. It bewildered me, but didn't too much faze me"
"
#0263",hall_female,"I dreamed that my sister, Martha, my mother and a friend of my sisters were in our kitchen at home. Mother seemed to be cooking on the stove. My sister, her friend and I lounged about talking. Suddenly the back door opened and my father lurched in drunk. I was faintly ashamed that Martha's friend should see him in such a condition. He seemed to have brought with him a florist's box which he laid on the kitchen table (it had a cover on it of red and white checks). It was for me and contained a beautiful orchid. A boy I date at school who lives out of town had sent it to me. Also in the box was a long rambling incoherent letter which seemed to be a declaration of love. I was overjoyed as it proved to me that even though we were separated, he had thought of me."
"
#0264",hall_female,"I dreamed that I was sitting in the back room of Moe's, a well known college beer joint and one I know fairly well. The back room looked a little different. I can only explain that it seemed to be turned around. I knew however that it was Moe's. It was a very colorful scene, looking rather like a Hollywood version of a dive. There were bluish clouds of smoke, people were dressed in colorful clothes. The scarred tables and chairs were the same as they really are. I was happy because I was in a place I knew well and was fond of. I decided that I would have a beer and called to Al, the bartender, to bring me one. He refused to do so. I couldn't understand this but I didn't feel that I should make a fuss. I felt rather inferior because while I was sitting with people I knew who were very friendly to me, I lacked an escort. Here the dream ended."
"
#0265",hall_female,"I dreamed that I was in a classroom about to take an examination. The test was handed out on white printed folded sheets. I unfolded mine and read the single question printed there. I read: trace the importance of erasers on the control of audio-sound frequencies. With a sinking feeling I realized that I knew absolutely nothing about the subject. I seized my pencil with determination and began to do what so many students try to do on exams--bull around, as it's known. I recall writing authoritatively (hoping I could fool the professor). ""It will readily be seen by any intelligent person that erasers are of the most extreme importance, etc."" I was quite worried that I would be seen through and receive a low grade"
"
#0267",hall_female,"The dream took place in a hotel where I was staying. There was a lot of confusion and noise. Everyone around seemed to be happy and festive. There were a lot of young people there. I was discussing things of interest with them. Then I was in another room. And in this room, in the bathroom, next to the bathtub, was a huge chair set up high. The chair itself was yellow leather and it was braced with large pieces of wood and made to look like a throne. The bottom of it was decorated in white tile, as was the bathroom. Then I noticed that draped here and there were rhinestone bracelets and necklaces; and gold belts with pseudo-jewels in them. Later I learned that this throne was used as a prop for the stage play of Macbeth. The person to whom it belonged was a young man about 27 years of age. He had dark hair. Someone was asking him how he got so many people to give up their rhinestone necklaces, bracelets and gold belts permanently for the construction of this throne. This man kept saying that the people didn't mind at all. This seemed to cause an argument between the two. Then I woke up."
"
#0269",hall_female,I was in a strange house in the town we lived in about 10 years ago. I was about the same age as I am now but it seemed that the time was about 8 years ago. My mother had decided to walk to the corner with the lady of this house who was about the same age as my mother. I said that I would take care of the children (who belonged to this lady) while they were gone. I watched them leave and a few minutes later there was a knock on the door. I thought as I answered it that I should look to see who it was before opening it. But I opened the door and there stood a big man. He was about 60 years of age and was unshaven with gray hair cut in a butch. He looked at me and smiled in a sort of fiendish way. Then he stroked the side of my face and said something I don't remember except that he called me dolly. It made me very angry and I could feel my heart pounding. Then he started to lunge at me and I ran. Pretty soon I found myself going down some back stairs outside the house and the man was gone. I felt weak from fright.
"
#0270",hall_female,"I was in the dormitory I lived in as a freshman in college. I was with two young men whom I knew. We were playing cards when we heard a lot of commotion in the halls. Then we heard police sirens in the distance. For no apparent reason we ran to escape the police. As we were making our way to the back fire escape, we heard someone say that there were three dead people in the ironing room. We stayed on the fire escape until the police left and then went in to look at these dead people. What I saw was not well defined. It just looked like a bunch of old dirty rags scattered about in heaps in the room. I was fully expecting to be horrified and felt much relieved when I could see nothing that resembled dead people. These young men were about the same age as I."
"
#0275",hall_female,"I dreamt that I was walking up a street and I met a friend of mine who was in her wedding dress. She was to be married that afternoon and she told me to come to the vacant lot where her friends were, as they wanted to see me. I said no, as I had not been asked to the wedding and felt self-conscious about being around there. However, next thing I knew I was there on some unknown porch, visiting with some old school-friends of mine. The girl whom I most wanted to see was not there, however. As the bride left for the church, she told me to come to the wedding, so I went home to get my husband, who said we shouldn't go. I woke up"
"
#0277",hall_female,"I was in a living room which was decorated in a very old-fashioned style. With me was one of my friends, a boy who is 21 years old and a senior at Reserve. We are very close friends, even though I am engaged. We were waiting for something and then an older woman came out. She was a secretary and told us that the judge would be with us very shortly. The judge came out and he was very jolly looking, had white hair and whiskers, a very large round belly, a veritable Santa Clause. He was clad in a wine colored satin dressing gown. He then proceeded to bawl out both me and my companion, although I do not know about what. Then his secretary came in and told the judge that his bath water was ready for him."
"
#0287",hall_female,"One of my best friends (f, 20) and I were in a classroom. The teacher was one (f, 50) we both had had in junior high school. We both disliked her. She taught sewing there. In the dream she was teaching typing. It was the first day of the semester. My friend had taken the second semester of the course the previous year, while I was new to the subject, not having taken any before. Therefore, my friend had the advantage of knowing the teacher's procedures etc. We were instructed to write a heading on the paper. I made a mistake and the teacher ridiculed me. On the board was a sample of the heading we were supposed to put on our paper. It was written partly in the handwriting of a grade school child and partly in an adult's handwriting. She instructed us to do more things (forgotten now--never remembered clearly) and I did not do them correctly."
"
#0292",hall_female,"I dreamed I was on a streetcar on Euclid Ave. The car was going towards the city. A boy I know got on the car with a dog. I knew he shouldn't have, but he said it would be all right. The conductor opened the doors at a stop and the dog jumped off and ran down the street. I was worried about the dog and this boy and I got off of the streetcar. We found the dog on the sidewalk outside of a store. I knew the dog was sick and dying. He appeared to be flat against the sidewalk. He was trying to move but he couldn't. I told the boy to get the dog to a doctor but he thought the dog was all right."
"
#0298",hall_female,"I dreamed that my 2 girl cousins, ages 11 and 15, who live in L.A.; my sisters, ages 11 and 17; and I, were standing in an apartment building somewhere in Cleveland ringing my grandparents' door bell. (My grandfather passed away a year ago, and my grandmother lives in Los Angeles.) My grandparents were supposed to take us on a picnic but no one answered the bell. So my cousins, my sisters, and I got on a streetcar and on the streetcar we met our grandparents. My grandfather told us that they had had to leave Cleveland suddenly to go to Los Angeles because my grandmother's sister had died. I remember him saying ""Can you imagine that?"" and I felt surprised that he had said that because I knew that my grandparents and my grandmother's sister had never gotten along. Then my grandparents began to playfully argue and everyone on the streetcar laughed. I woke up and, when I did, I felt happy and satisfied because I had seen my grandfather so clearly."
"
#0299",hall_female,"First I found myself sitting inside a movie theater dressed in a formal gown and my date (whose name I cannot recall) was sitting next to me. Then I found myself on Cedar and Lee Rd. walking with a person, but this person kept changing; first it was one of my girlfriends and then it ended up to be my sister who is 17 years old. Then 2 men began following us (one man I have never seen before; the other one lives in my neighborhood and acts strangely.) I felt horrified that the men would catch us, but the bus stopped for us and we got on safely."
"
#0303",hall_female,It seems I was in some small office. I know I was working there but I don't know exactly what were my duties. I know that there were several other people in the office. After a while we all got tired of working and the boss decided we go out for some coffee. There were enough men in the office for the girls and all of the girls went out of the office with a boy. I know that this place was either in France or in an export house in the U.S. where they spoke French because I was aware that they were speaking French. The other people in the office were the same age as I.
"
#0310",hall_female,"I was a ballerina; wearing a frilly pink dancing dress. I was dancing in, supposedly, Reserve's new student union. There were lots of kids standing around the grill and at the booths. None I recognized however. At the top of a double stairs stood Bill, an old boyfriend wearing a black overcoat, which had the collar pulled up around the neck. I was trying to impress him with my dancing. Everyone else smiled and commented how nice I looked and how well I was doing, while Bill merely glared down at me. Then I whirled around the other direction and two men were sitting on a marble bench and doors shut behind me to separate me from my friends in the other room. I danced before these two, didn't recognize either one, then one of them came over, grabbed my arm and said, marry me, and suddenly his face cleared up and he was a fraternity brother of Mac's whose name I don't even know. I felt very badly because I knew the man was married."
"
#0314",hall_female,"I am walking along a river which is more likely to be a canal, with trees on both sides and high grass, fresh and green, full of pink and red flowers. Everything is calm and so peaceful that one does feel like laying down and daydreaming. But I go on with the idea that I have to take a steamer which must be anchored here, some place, and that I cannot find. I am looking for it, but I am not too eager to find it; everything around me is so nice and appealing and makes me feel like staying. I have the impression of being really alone, but I am not concerned about it. On the contrary, I feel very much relieved to have nobody to push me around. Just something very softly in me makes me walk toward that boat which is going to take me home."
"
#0316",hall_female,"This dream was completely confusing and uncorrelated. Only a few of the details stand out in my mind, while the others remain obscure. I recall being in Saks 34 St., a department store in N.Y.C., with a few friends of mind. We were all trying on dresses when suddenly we heard an explosion coming from the distance. At this point my dream began to wander between two definite themes--one having to do with something concerning the United Nations building and another having to do with a boat smuggling dope in N.Y. harbor. I don't recall any of the details, except that it was a Coast Guard boat firing on the boat with the dope, which seemed to cause the explosion, but where the various details met I cannot seem to remember."
"
#0320",hall_female,"I dreamt that I had become pregnant, although I wasn't married. Obviously I had had sexual intercourse (with my boyfriend, TG) although I can't recall experiencing the act in my dream. By the time I realized I was pregnant I was in my second month. I was not in the least bit worried or frightened but even happy, and I told my parents (mother, 45; father, 49) about it. They weren't at all concerned or ashamed of the fact and told me to ask TG to marry me. When I told him he said he couldn't until he finished scratching his uncle IG's back. There was no reason why he should have been scratching it, but he was. I became very angry and spoke to his parents (mother, 52; father 55). His mother told me how unjust that was and said she would speak to him. I also told his father and he became so angry at TG that he began to beat him up. At that point my dream ended, and I was in the stage between being awake and asleep; but I was acutely aware of the fact that I was very married and when I finally awoke completely I was in a cold sweat."
"
#0322",hall_female,"I had gone down to the Schofield Bldg. Used to work there. Had stopped in to see my old boss and found out that the girl who had taken my place had left. They wanted me to come back to work and I couldn't give them any definite answer inasmuch as I was, or am, presently working. The bookkeeper was there, though she had changed quite a bit. She had now become quite gray, was wearing black and looked very old. I felt a little guilty for not going to work there. While I was there I noticed a number of applicants, all of whom were elderly women and all of whom were wearing black. I left there and went to my job. When I got there I found Bess, the bookkeeper from my former job, now working on my books. She told me she had quit and was now working for my boss. I then thought that this was a good idea as Bess was an accountant and, with her ability, deserved a better job than the one she had."
"
#0330",hall_female,"A young couple, friends of mine, were getting married. (I recognize neither of them.) After the wedding, they were fooling around downstairs, with a whole gang of kids surrounding them. Some girl piped up with a cute crack and the groom said: see, I told you what a doll she is (referring to the bride). Later on, they went to bed in my brother's bedroom. Mother suggested various things she ought to do for them. I said she should just leave them alone. She said she had taken care of many couples in that room, and she knew what was best. I still insisted she should just let them alone."
"
#0331",hall_female,"I was lying half in my bed which is beside a window and half out on a ledge which seemed to be attached to the window sill. N, a friend my own age, came into the room and stood beside the bed. A black cat appeared on the ledge and I screamed at N to take the cat away, as I dislike them intensely. She picked the cat up and was holding it. I said to be sure not to let it loose in my room. She smiled and dropped the cat, which ran out of the room. A spotted cat appeared on the floor and I screamed again. The cat jumped onto the ledge which was 3 stories up from the ground. I wanted to push the cat off but was afraid to touch it. N. just stood there and watched me. The black cat came back into the room, jumped from the bed to the ledge and touched my leg. By this time I seemed to be having a mild case of hysteria."
"
#0334",hall_female,I was in the basement of a house which was filled with water. I kept swimming back and forth from one end of the house to the other. I thought I was alone until I heard a loud splash. I turned and saw Mr. B. (a married man who lived next door to my family over 5 years ago and I used to baby sit with his daughter.) He swam over to me and I realized that he was naked. I was also but it didn't seem to be wrong. We swam about together and eventually he kissed me and later we had intercourse under the water. I asked him where his wife was and he said she would be down soon. She did come down very soon and saw us together. This did not shock or even surprise her. I kept swimming back and forth until I was very tired.
"
#0338",hall_female,"I was driving home from the show alone, and I was at Richmond and Mayfield or somewhere when I got lost and ran out of gas. I got out of the car and walked up the hill in the snow. Four little boys were playing where my glasses had fallen off so I went back to pick them up. But the smallest boy had [them] and wouldn't give them to me unless I gave him a dime. Then he dropped them and both frames and lenses broke. I couldn't drive without them so I was very angry and made him give me his name and address so I could send his mother the bill (the name was Asa something!). I went home for my streetcar pass so I could go back and get the car. It was cold and night time and I was dead tired and my father couldn't drive me there because his car was broken. It was about dawn when I went outside. In front of our house was a car with a boy I know in it with his three roommates sleeping. I woke them up and the boy held out my car key to me. I don't know why this was so wonderful but I didn't have to go back for my car. There was snow on the ground too."
"
#0339",hall_female,"I dreamt I had a date with my ex-husband. Before the movie we met at a drugstore lunch counter and had bacon, lettuce, tomato sandwiches. While we were sitting there, he started a quarrel about something I can't remember but I know it was petty. Then he walked out. So I bought a box of popcorn and went to the movie alone. It was a downtown theater and an usher seated me as if the seats were reserved. The movie ""Hansel and Gretal"" was playing. At the back of the show were tables, as if it were a first-class restaurant, so I went back there to sit with my younger sister (20) and my older married sister (26). The waiter helped me off with my coat and I sat with them but we didn't order anything to eat. I remember that it was snowing and slushy outside and we all wore boots. The alarm woke me before the movie started but I vaguely recall that it had suddenly turned to summer and we were out on a terrace."
"
#0340",hall_female,"My parents took in a male boarder, and we were attracted to each other, although we never said anything. We just exchanged glances. Then we had to move and I would have to transfer colleges or board at school which I didn't like. We were going to move to Willoughby, I believe. We went to look for a house and found one on the next street. It was pink and cost $75.00 a month for rent. We went to look at it and liked the big backyard. When we came back to our house, my father was sitting on the porch talking to 2 elderly men. It was summertime. I remember realizing that my father was getting old because he never takes time out to relax long enough to sit on the porch. It made me a little sad. But I was glad we had found a house here so I wouldn't have to transfer schools."
"
#0355",hall_female,"Mother and I were driving along the street when I saw the mother of a girl I knew from high school who had just been married. We stopped to talk to her when the girl whom had just been married the day before came toward us. I wanted to talk to her. She came towards us backwards and when she turned to face us, she was a heavy Negro girl. I stared at her for a minute. I said, ""I hope you got through it alright,"" meaning the wedding ceremony, but my mother and the girl's mother thought I meant something dirty. I tried to convince them that I hadn't meant anything obscene, but neither would believe me. I felt terrible"
"
#0356",hall_female,"A girl in a pair of pants and bra only was standing on the stairs. I identified the girl as one in my dorm. Her legs were very tan and long and more thin than any I have ever seen. It seems my boyfriend was looking in and admiring her and stroked her leg once. I was somewhat jealous, but I tried not to appear so. I don't remember for sure, but it seems that I dismissed Helen, whose legs are not like that, by saying, ""That's all,"" as though she were a model or something. There was no rancor in my tone, only command"
"
#0357",hall_female,"I dreamt I was supposed to go fishing on a fairly big boat. I was near the sea and it seemed evening since the sky was so overcast. It seemed that this expedition was part of a class requirement in which the majority were males--something at that. They were waiting for me and I was trying to get a fishing rod. I called to them to help me if they were in such a hurry, but they wouldn't, so I started picking out and untangling a line I found there in the sand, thinking to drop it in and hold it wound on a stick. They said it would be fine. Then my mother came and said it was so squally that she didn't think she'd go and I thought about it and decided I wouldn't either, so I told them to go ahead and leave. Then later someone came to my house and seemed quite distraught. The ship had gone down and she was grieving for her son. I had been in bed, but got up and began putting on my clothes to go and look for him. I had the feeling, however, that he was dead. I also felt glad that I hadn't gone on the trip. I also felt that his arm was off"

#0359",hall_female,"I was in a class being conducted in a damp, marshy wood. The professor was lecturing in front of this little cabin, but my seat was behind it, so I asked him if he minded my sitting in front so I could see, and he said that he did and said to me something about not enough seats, these all being taken and kids took the seats that I had thought I would take one of. Then I looked about for a place to sit and debated sitting on some wooden planks over some watery part, but decided it was to damp. Meanwhile, someone started to talk, seemed like gibberish or maybe she sang. The professor beckoned to me and I realized that he had made me a flat seat to sit on and had I sat down with it where I was, speaker and the prof. sat down on the grass. The seat he had made me was quite wide, so I moved over and invited him to sit next to me. Meanwhile the speaker went on. I was a little worried that the class might think I was brown-nosing, sitting next to the teacher, but I wasn't embarrassed. The dream ended"

#0377",hall_female,"I dreamt that I was sitting in Kulas with my father. There were 6 beautiful chandeliers on the ceiling. While we were sitting there, a bomb fell, but it didn't harm anything and the people continued to sit there and the program went on also. All of a sudden I decided to find my mother. I left my father and went near the back to sit with mother. I had just sat down when they called me up on the stage. They asked me to tap dance. I told them I couldn't dance, but I would sing for them. I started to sing and found myself in my own living room singing for my grandmother, mother and father"

#0382",hall_female,"I was swimming at a lake with some boy around 27 years of age. The lake itself was not familiar. It was one which had swamps on one side. It was nighttime and a full moon was shining. This boy and I went swimming. Suddenly a large muscular Negro man started chasing us. We swam towards the swamps, the man following. In the middle of the swamp was a house. We ran into it and hid upstairs. The man followed us there and entered the house. The dream ended. I have dreamt this dream 3 times -not in successive nights"

He lived quite far away, so I said he could stay our place that night, but forgot to ask my mother if he could stay. He came--drove a red convertible--and we three went out together. Mother rode in front with him. I rode in the back. Found out he had just gotten out of the hospital. For some reason he kept scratching his head and asked me for a Kleenex so I thought he had had a head operation. Then I just forgot he was even there as I talked to mother and tried to convince her that he should stay at our place. When I finished, I suddenly realized he was there and I was very embarrassed, as was he"

#0388",hall_female,"We were going to a big family get together--when we got there everyone was going to various formals and strangely enough, we were all dressed for it. My mother was in a very short fantastic formal. My sister and some of the younger folks were going, but I didn't have a date--though I didn't want to go, they made me come along too. We drove to one fellow's house to see if he would go. It was then 4:00. He came out without tie, hair and clothes all mussed up. I made him go back in and change, then we left for the formal. At one time he asked me what kind of drink I could afford and I told him none. I didn't drink"

Everybody in my group, consisting of B-W students, seemed to know this fellow. He evidently had been a student here, but I couldn't quite catch the name. The next week I discovered it was Jack Obert. He was pinned to a sorority sister of mine, but she didn't seem to be affected. I remember going by the Lambda Chi house and I wondered why they didn't have a black wreath on the door. In what seemed to be the next week in the dream, I learned some of the details of the crash such as it happened in Euclid and a truck crashed into a car in which Jack had been a passenger"

#0399",hall_female,"My father and mother had become parents of a baby boy. I went to see him at the hospital and he was absolutely the smallest baby I'd ever seen. It seems my mother was my father's third wife. I was the daughter of his 1st wife and my younger sister was the daughter of his 2nd wife. However, the 3rd wife in the dream had the appearance of my real mother. My dad was very happy because it was a boy. Suddenly the happy father was my husband and he said, ""I knew you'd come through."" It seems that I was the mother"

#0403",hall_female,"It was 10:20 at night and I had forgotten my biology book over in the boiler room. Lights are out in our dorm at 10:30 and I had to get permission from our house director to go over to get it. It was real dark in the boiler room and I couldn't find my books. I looked and looked and finally went to the third floor to look for them. It was still dark--but a little lighter. Then I saw a bunch of kids from home. I talked to all of them at first. Then I was talking to this guy who I used to go with. We talked and then argued and then laughed. Then he crawled out the window and I had a party with the other kids. But I was unhappy because this guy left and I didn't have my biology studied for the test. I was also worried because I was going to be campused because I didn't go straight back to the dorm. When I went back, Mrs. Sanky, our house mother, hollered and campused me"

The kids in the bus were laughing and crying. I could see my roommate in one of the windows and she was crying and crying. I knew she was unhappy, but I didn't know why. Then somebody, it was a man, sneaked out to the middle of the road and put down a big log in front of the bus. Then a train came along and hit the bus too. Kids went flying all over. I couldn't do a thing to help--couldn't stop the bus--the man--or the train. Then I couldn't find my roommate anywhere. I was very unhappy"

#0406",hall_female,"I was walking down a street with a group of boys and girls all my own age. In the distance I could see a building. This building was queerly shaped, the roof coming to a point. There was a garage attached to one side of it. I said that the building should be used for the rec hall because it was much nicer than the present rec hall. One of the boys in the crowd said that that was impossible because there wouldn't be a 50-foot clearance. I asked what a 50-foot clearance was needed for and he said because of playing basketball. I became rather confused since I knew they didn't play basketball in the rec hall"

#0408",hall_female,"I was coming home from college. I was rather peeved because I had to come home on the streetcar. It was Christmas time and I had a lot to bring home. The trouble was that I had so many small suitcases that I couldn't' keep count of them. I went to my grandmother's house because that is where we always have Christmas dinner. I felt hurt because when I got there, everyone was eating and no one had waited for me. After dinner I went into the bedroom and there was a large suitcase, big enough for all my stuff. I asked my aunt to whom the larger suitcase belonged, to please give me the suitcase, but she said no I couldn't have it"

#0416",hall_female,I was writing out invitations to a wedding when suddenly I seemed to be in the midst of a crowd of people who were celebrating something. It must have been my wedding because I wanted to open some gifts but someone stopped me saying that there would be time for that later. A gypsy came to the door and it developed she was Japanese and she seemed to be looking for someone. Then I was in an alley or basement or someplace small but dark. I saw two shadows on the wall and then just one. A woman was on the ground. She looked very still. This Japanese gypsy had hit her on the head. She was a very nice woman. She had done a ______ at the wedding and everyone liked her

#0418",hall_female,"After packing a suitcase to leave with my husband, we began driving on country roads among the hills. I remember particularly now how green and beautiful the hills were. We decided to stop and see a mine. My husband has been there before. It was a peanut mine! We walked down many stairs and could see miners going down another stairway. We finally came to an elevator. It was in the shape of the peanut man which is in advertisements so much. I was frightened to get in it, but my husband told me it was all right. I was to count to ten aloud so that he would know when to take the next elevator. I was terrified because I didn't know when to start counting"

#0423",hall_female,"I dreamed that was in typing class and the world's greatest typist (don't remember her name) was there and the kids in our typing class were trying to beat this famous typist. We all had three times to try and see if we could type faster than she could because there was a prize of $11,000 to the one who could beat her. No one could, but then on my last try I finally beat her by 1 stroke. Just as they were handing me the money, I woke up. What a disappointment because I never did get the money"

#0427",hall_female,"I was on the stage trying out for a part or I had the part. Many people were on the stage walking off and on. Confusion was present. Next I was in a room trying to find clothes to put on. I had one outfit on but found a brand new skirt so I put the new skirt on with a blouse. I had two sorority pins on. One was plain gold and the other had pearls. I asked a friend in the room if I cold wear them and she said yes, so everyone would know I was in a sorority. I then took off he plain pin, but kept the pearl pin on. At the end I was back on the stage with an audience, but not doing anything"

#0444",hall_female,"I had a dream about one of my girlfriends here at school. She was roller skating down a hill and couldn't stop when she came to the street and saw a car coming. The car hit her and knocked all her front teeth out. She had gold teeth put in to replace them. The next scene took place in MP's dining hall where she was waiting to eat dinner. She was all decked out in slinky clothes, including an inch of mascara and makeup and false eyelashes. Somehow her boyfriend was there too and when he saw her, he exclaimed over how terrible she looked and said he'd never go out with her again. All she could say was that she couldn't help it. The roller skates wouldn't stop"
"
#0446",hall_female,"This dream took place entirely in one room and instead of a so-called plot, I dreamed of the room itself. It was supposedly a double room in a dorm. It was a corner room and had two windows. The companion wallpaper was flowered and was brown in color. There were twin beds in the room with chenille bedspreads. There were to desks, one being black and two dressers. Two pictures of my roommate were hanging on the wall. The floor was completely covered with maroon carpeting. My roommate was standing in front of the closet between the beds, and I was standing at the door leading into the hall. We were attempting to decide how we should rearrange the rooms we wouldn't have to walk around the bed every time we went to the closet"

#0447",hall_female,"I had been working for hours ruling off a card to use for roll call in a swimming class. I did it all in India ink and as soon as I had al l the members in the class listed on the card, I gave it to the instructor of the class, Dorothy Crandall. However, she already had a swim roll exact like the one I had made, and so I told her that I had made it for the fun of it and she didn't have to use it. But she said that she needed it and so she decided to keep it"
"
#0451",hall_female,"Once more I was swimming, this time in the pond in front of my grandmother's house. It's a fairly large sized pond, but no one hardly ever swims in it due to the numerous cattails and seaweed growths. It is known to have no bottom because of its base of muck. Well, on with the dream. It wasn't an especially different dream, not even exciting. Tom and I were simply swimming around. I remember remarking what a good tan he had. Oh yes, once as I was getting out of the water, the top of my bathing suit came down. Tom didn't seem to notice it, though, so I fixed it and we went on swimming as before. Pretty soon three boys came up. I believe they were supposed to be cousins from Pennsylvania. I recognized one named Mickey, but the faces weren't familiar. I introduced them all to Tom who by the way is my boyfriend. The next thing I remember is being at someone's house, but I don't remember where or who was there"

#0464",hall_female,"I found myself standing on the corner of W. 48th and Bridge Ave. On the corner stood a dilapidated old house. There was no door and I walked in. The house was being remodeled. The interior was very beautiful. I noticed one very large wall near an archway; it was completely bare. Adjacent to it was another wall. This wall was very narrow and cluttered with lamps. I walked down a corridor and came upon 4 bedrooms, then I heard footsteps and quickly hid behind a door. A young man walked in looking for whoever had been making the noises. All of a sudden I discovered that I was unclad. I then realized it was twice as important for him not to see me. Then all of a sudden he found me, but I was fully clad when he did. We walked to the front part of the house and there I noticed his wife. She was pregnant. They were both friendly to me; they explained that they were looking for a place to live and found this house. The lady who owned the house was against renting to young couples, but changed her mind when she saw how beautiful the interior was. I remember very well that the man's wife was very sweet and smiled constantly"

#0467",hall_female,"I was in a downtown shopping district with two other girls. We were in a very big hurry to get someplace by 6 p.m. The one girl wanted to go to a clothing shop which was located on the 25th floor of a very old building. We went there and looked at some bathing suit. From here I remember waiting for an elevator. There was a man following us from this time on. We always knew he was near because of a very mysterious whistle. However, he never caught up with us. We were always in a hurry throughout the dream"
"
#0471",hall_female,"This dream concerned a sorority sister who was planning to be married soon; a sort of preview of the wedding. The auditorium was filled with thousands of people. There was an altar like all churches, but there were no pews. The people were sitting on stone bleachers. I was to be one of the attendants in the wedding and although not the maid of honor, I was to bring the groom's ring. The bride to be informed me that the ring was on a table near the altar and I was to pick it up before the service. The processional started and I followed the maid of honor down the aisle. I picked up the ring and started to leave the altar to go to my seat in the congregation. At that point, my costume was changed and I was just a spectator. The bride became frantic as she looked for the ring. Then I suddenly stood up and shouted, ""Here it is."" I tried frantically to get it to her, but too many people gathered around me and refused to let me through. At this point, the scene changed and I was with a group of friends, both male and female, eating in the hold of a ship. There were shells and mounted fish on the walls, and a foul fish smell. Everyone began talking and laughing and then I woke"
"
#0475",hall_female,"This dream occurred at my home where a deserter from the army was now hiding. This soldier was the same young man I had dreamed about the night before. Our fruit cellar seemed to be very well stocked. In fact, it was overcrowded. We were living in our basement recreation room and using the fruit cellar for a bomb shelter. Outdoors bombs were being dropped, but the only visible damage was the presence of huge holes in the streets. There were road blocks at close intervals along the street and I was unsuccessfully trying to push my grandfather's large two-wheeled cart down the middle of the road. This seemed to be piled high with cabbages of all things, which weren't in the best condition. During this time, the blond lad was hiding in the house peering from the front window of the bedroom which was mine while I was in high school. All day he sat there focusing my dad's binoculars on the enemy soldiers who were patrolling the five points in front of our house. Only at night did he leave the house. At this time we would go for walks together"

#0484",hall_female,"I was at a summer resort. As I was going down the stairs into the beach, I saw on one part of this beach huge cockroaches. I hurriedly ran past them and safely went into the water. There were many others in the water with me and the shore I saw a little dark-haired boy playing in the sand. To the left of me by the water was a public beach and many were swimming there in the water. Later I went into the house where everyone was eating. A lady and her little baby were sitting by me. I noticed that there were little bugs around the table. Everyone seemed very happy."

#0486",hall_female,"In this dream I was downtown in Cleveland. I had just decided on a new dress and was about to charge it when I realized I had lost the charge plate. I told my parents when I got home and my father immediately called the store to cancel all charges. It was too late, however, as someone had found the plate and charged over $100 in merchandise. My father was furious and said I had to earn the $100 and pay him back this summer. I felt he was unfair because anyone might have lost a plate. I woke in the midst of quarreling with everyone"
"
#0490",hall_female,"This is one of the dreams I had last night. I found myself at home seeing for the first time the new house my parents bought. I understood it to be new, but it turned out to be a made-over model of my aunt's old farmhouse. I was disgusted with the whole thing, but I tried not to let my parents see it. I kept exclaiming how each thing was so nice and at the same time was trying to figure out in my mind how they could possibly like the atrocious thing. I remember the wall between the living room and dining room was nothing but a huge aquarium. The kitchen had absolutely none of the latest conveniences, including no linoleum. For some reason, I began to search for my old bicycle and was awakened at this point"
"
#0492",hall_female,"I dreamt that I had to take a psychology test. If I missed the test, I would get a bad grade. I was over at Adelbert watching the fellows practice football. I had a little more studying to do and I couldn't make myself do it. When I looked at my watch, I was very late for my test. I ran all the way to the room where I was having the test. I only had a few minutes for the test. I could not stay over because I had lab in the afternoon. I was sure the test would be on something I didn't know. Sure enough, I was handed a piece of paper and then a piece of coal. It was reddish brown and I was supposed to tell what the reddish brown color on the outside was. I didn't have any idea of the answer"
"
#0495",hall_female,"I dreamt that a fellow I know came to the house and we were supposed to go out. I didn't like him very well and I wasn't too glad to go out. When he came, I found out he was married to my cousin who was staying with us at the time. He was dating me in order that he could see her. They had kept their marriage a secret. My first reaction was that I was glad he married her instead of me. Then I was surprised and puzzled why my cousin would want to marry him. I didn't consider him a desirable husband. I had refused to go out with him and had even told her I didn't like him. Then I was riding in the car with them as they were going on their honeymoon. He held her hand and again I couldn't understand why she wanted to marry him. Then I was angry that they had used me in order to keep their purpose a secret"
