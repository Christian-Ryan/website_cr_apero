I am a Senior Lecturer in Clinical Psychology at the School of Applied Psychology in University College Cork and a Clinical Psychologist in private practice. I am involved in all aspects of the doctoral programme in Clinical Psychology including teaching, research, selection and placement visits. I have specific responsibilities for placement coordinator and lead the modules on Intellectual disabilities and Autism. I also contribute to the MA programme in Mental Health and supervise students for MA research projects. In the past few years I have been developing my skills in using the R programming language as a tool for research, statistical analysis and text mining. My blog posts below feature some of my explorations using R in psychology. Feel free to message me if you have ideas to improve the code or have other comments or feedback.
