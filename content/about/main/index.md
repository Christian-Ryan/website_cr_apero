  I am a Senior Lecturer in Clinical Psychology at the School of Applied Psychology in University College Cork and a Clinical Psychologist in private practice. I am currently Acting Director and involved in all aspects of the programme including teaching, research, selection and placement visits. I have specific responsibilities for placement coordination and lead the modules on Intellectual disabilities and Autism. <br> <br> I also contribute to the MA programme in Applied Psychology (Mental Health) and supervise students for MA research projects. In the past few years I have been developing my skills in using the R programming language as a tool for research, statistical analysis and text mining. My blog posts on this site feature some of my explorations using R in psychology. Feel free to message me if you have ideas to improve the code or have other comments or feedback.
